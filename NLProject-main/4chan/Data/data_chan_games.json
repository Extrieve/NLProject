The second pro is the treble, which extends really well, and is also really hard to fix with EQ on cheaper headphones.That being said, if you like Blessing, you should just buy Zero.

After they all went back to their tiny shared appartments, I decided to take a shower in the office gym. The showers, roomy with their black tiled floors and walls, were actually a very relaxing and a spiritual moment for me when I wanted to escape from the smell of soul-penetrating currynigger I had to spend my time during the day in. As I undressed, I lighted a few scented candles and placed them in a pentagram in front of a picture of Steve Ballmer. After all, he was the true OG CEO of Microsoft. Blessed by His display, I entered the showers. I adjusted the temperature from &#039;Mumbai&#039; to &#039;Ballmer&#039;, the increase of temperature always makes me sweat and forget about the the stupid KPIs I still had to get signed off. As the water drips down my body and flows over my genitals, I cannot help getting erect. The warm Ballmeresque water stimulates the tip of my penis and I simply cannot resist. Just a few tugs, not more. &quot;Enjoying ourselves, I see?&quot;. A tingle runs down my spine. That voice. Could it be? No, impossible. I turn my head towards the voice. A large, heavy built ex-CEO stands in the opening of the shower, his belly barely exposing his large-shapen manhood. &quot;Seems you&#039;re due for a promotion soon&quot;, he says as he starts walking towards me, sweat already dripping from his nipples before he even takes the first step. &quot;H-hi&quot;, I stumble for words. &quot;Don&#039;t worry, I can make sure you get that fat paycheck. But first...&quot; he grabs my cock &quot;a little something in return.&quot; He tugs me off for a moment, I want to resist, but his grip is too strong... and it feels good too. He stops, grabs my ass and turns me around. &quot;Now, for a little good old fashioned Windows ME&quot;. A sharp stab in the rear. I feel it entering. I resist a little, but his thrust is too strong.

I understand the modern web is quite bad due to a myriad of issues such as the overuse of Javascript and just bad practice in general (like using 20mb photos everywhere lmao), but it truly is great for reaching audiences and creating independent income sources. The only problem with the web I can really see is only people being retarded. But just because your programming language filters out most stupid people doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s more useful.By all means, keep programming in C or whatever. It&#039;s great to have software that runs on people&#039;s machines offline, natively, and isn&#039;t massively abstracted from hardware. I actually wish there was more of it because I REFUSE to run the dogshit that is named &quot;GIMP&quot; on my Linux machine, so I&#039;m forced to use retarded web bloat like photopea.com instead. It&#039;s gay and depressing, but really my only option.

There&#039;s no place to demo any higher end hifimans than the ananda in my country and there very few such headphones out here. Arya and the higher end ones are probably somewhat better still. I like that the ananda is easy to drive and sounds amazing from any source, while this would not necessarily be the case with the higher end ones. I&#039;ve demo&#039;d the old edition x and it was what originally hooked me on hifimans, demoing it in the shop I remember it sounding as amazing as ananda did and having exactly the qualities I liked and most.(I bought my ananda used for 500 eurobucks a year ago).",

        "&gt;&gt;89325625OP, you are a retard if all you can save up is $500. Regardless, that should be enough to get a decent desktop for programming, as you can just skip getting a GPU. If you play vidya and &quot;need&quot; one, grow the fuck up unironically. All you have to do is look at the millennial generation to see what vidya did to them. READ READ READ and READ instead. You and I both only have informal self-education to our advantage, so it&#039;s important to leverage it.Again, since I&#039;m not a programmer, it&#039;s hard to say what language you should learn. I first started out learning Python and I deeply regret it. Its only advantage is that it&#039;s a scripting language, so it&#039;s easy to get started with, but other than that it&#039;s extremely slow, difficult to read (due to the lack of syntax), and hard to write (because of the forced indentation). If I were to start again, I would learn HTML and CSS and make some STATIC websites. This is very easy to do and rewarding, as you get to see the fruits of your labor visually and instantly. Learning to put a website on the internet will also teach you a lot about computer networking, which is important. After you get HTML and CSS down to a science, then you can start learning TypeScript (a better version of JavaScript), which will allow you to make DYNAMIC websites, which allow people to interact with your website instead of just reading it.WAGMI fren.

    "UX designers expect to get paid for their work. It&#039;s that simple. GNU/LInux was made by programmers. Programmers sucks at UX design. All of the good UX designers are employed by Apple. Microsoft and Google are getting the rejects from Apple, and GNU is left to pick through the scraps. The largest DE&#039;s out there, GNOME, KDE.etc were designed by programmers who only understand a superficial level of what makes a good user experience. They copy whatever Apple is doing but put more effort in things like backend scripting and module management than polish. It&#039;s basically all Linux developers know how to do. A user interface is its own separate discipline, and Apple hires people who spent years in a design school for their degrees. How can GNU/Linux compete? Unfortunately, most people&#039;s first impression of an operating system comes from the interface. GNU / Linux is an incredible piece of engineering in the right hands, but its user interface standards are why it will remain dead on desktop and laptop computers.*drops mic*": [

PowerShell pipelines operate line by line, without waiting for the previous step to finish.So the naive ways above will start overwriting file.txt after the first line and the rest of the file is lost (obviously bad).# this will NOT WORKGet-Content &quot;file.txt&quot; | ForEach-Object {  return $_ -replace &quot;[^A-Za-z0-9._-]&quot;, &quot;_&quot;} | Set-Content &quot;file.txt&quot;So what we can do is wrap the get-content call is parentheses to tell powershell to run that step to completion before moving on.# this will work(Get-Content &quot;file.txt&quot;) | ForEach-Object {  return $_ -replace &quot;[^A-Za-z0-9._-]&quot;, &quot;_&quot;} | Set-Content &quot;file.txt&quot;...but theres a better wayNow we dont actually need the foreach-object loop! Why? Because the parentheses around get-content makes it expand out in-place into a large array of strings.. And strings all support the... &#039;replace&#039; operator we were trying to use the whole time.#so you can do this(Get-Content &quot;file.txt&quot;) -replace &quot;[^A-Za-z0-9._-]&quot;, &quot;_&quot; | Set-Content &quot;file.txt&quot;Just be aware that the default encoding of Set-Content is probably not what you want",
