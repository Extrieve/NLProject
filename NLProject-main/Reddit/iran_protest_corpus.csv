> Iran&#039;s state television said 41 people have been killed since the protests broke out following Amini&#039;s death on Sept 16.

ipwuvwp,worldnews,"Just for some context on what Iran is not friendly to the USA:

The USA did have them fully surrounded by military bases until Afghanistan fell.  Now we have them halfway surrounded.  We are right there, on their border with military.

The USA put in the Shah of Iran who let the USA profit greatly from taking Iran's oil.    Installing your leader is not a way to earn friends in a country.  USA versions make it sound like we liberated the country, but imagine Russia installing a leader of the USA and how that would make you feel.

We've been doing ""Maximum Sanctions"" against Iran for years now, trying to make their lives as miserable as we can.  We did this after WE backed out of a treaty we signed without justification beyond Trump didn't like it.

We strongly support Israel and give Israel billions in defense gear (and money to buy defense gear) each year.  Israel and Iran are sworn enemies, so we are arming their enemy.

Israel swore up and down that Iran would have nukes in less than 2 years and the USA should bomb them.  Instead, a treaty was formed to stop them from getting nukes and it was working until Trump.  Iran began the nuke program again and even after 5 years hasn't been threatening nukes so Israel was probably lying and trying to get us to bomb Iran without just cause.

USA and Israel teamed up to blow up centrifuges in Iran which are hard to get because we try to blockade tech purchases.  At first it was ""wow, who did it?"" but Israel stood up and said ""IT WAS US!! AND THE USA HELPED"" which was just provoking hatred.

There's a lot more, but I'll stop and let you research if you care.  But the feelings Iran has towards the USA have a lot of justification.  I personally don't like Iran much, and I hate their leaders with a passion, but I think it is unfair to say the people randomly say ""death the America"" for no other reason than they were told to.",1664152953.0

It's the Reddit brainwashing. Redditors see photos of cute iranian girls in western clothes from the 60s before the iranian revolution in /OldSchoolCool, and then they go from there.  
The brainwashing won't let them see that said girls were from the very top of elite families who could even afford a camera for candid pics. They don't know that the rest of the country - filthy poor - hated the western puppet king (the Shah) for being bloodthirsty *and* sucking up to the west.

(A stance the *Truman* administration supported, initially.)

Once again your pie-eyed view of “pushing the Shah to return” is so naive it borders on childlike.

The driving force behind the 1979 revolution was a swell of anti-Western sentiment, but to claim it was because of “moving people into cities” and “industrialization” is backward Orientalism masquerading as political insight, and the kind political perspective an idiot would glean from having their only perspective on Iran be a Larry The Cable Guy set from 2004.

It does get more complicated than this as Persian also uses words to denote formality which is not really a thing in English, but you can kinda think of them as prefixes. I say this to clarify because unless specified you can approximate death to America is more like f\*ck your government, which is a sentiment most Americans share.

The USA did have them fully surrounded by military bases until Afghanistan fell.  Now we have them halfway surrounded.  We are right there, on their border with military.

The USA put in the Shah of Iran who let the USA profit greatly from taking Iran's oil.    Installing your leader is not a way to earn friends in a country.  USA versions make it sound like we liberated the country, but imagine Russia installing a leader of the USA and how that would make you feel.

We've been doing ""Maximum Sanctions"" against Iran for years now, trying to make their lives as miserable as we can.  We did this after WE backed out of a treaty we signed without justification beyond Trump didn't like it.

We strongly support Israel and give Israel billions in defense gear (and money to buy defense gear) each year.  Israel and Iran are sworn enemies, so we are arming their enemy.

Israel swore up and down that Iran would have nukes in less than 2 years and the USA should bomb them.  Instead, a treaty was formed to stop them from getting nukes and it was working until Trump.  Iran began the nuke program again and even after 5 years hasn't been threatening nukes so Israel was probably lying and trying to get us to bomb Iran without just cause.

USA and Israel teamed up to blow up centrifuges in Iran which are hard to get because we try to blockade tech purchases.  At first it was ""wow, who did it?"" but Israel stood up and said ""IT WAS US!! AND THE USA HELPED"" which was just provoking hatred.

There's a lot more, but I'll stop and let you research if you care.  But the feelings Iran has towards the USA have a lot of justification.

ipwhsnl,worldnews,"Lol, please, get high-handed with me while being wrong. Mosaddegh was elected. He was appointed after being nominated by a wide margin. The US (and pals, but led by Kermit Roosevelt, Dulles and the CIA) orchestrated a coup because of moves made to nationalize oil and his efforts against the Shah to establish greater democratic control. The US “suggesting” the Shah return to Iran is so laughably naive the humor is crushed by its own self-evident sadness. Mosaddegh didn’t “become a dictator,” he introduced sweeping reforms and checked the power of the Shah even further. The 1979 revolution has many fathers, but the exile of Khomeini, the Shah being viewed as a Western catspaw, and late 70s economic issues all contributed. To lay it squarely at the feet of “the Shah was actually Westernizing Iran for the better, you guys” is entirely ignorant of both history and region writ large.

As to education via “other posts on Reddit,” the astounding gall it takes to accuse someone of ignorance when your own grasp of history seems to be drawn James Jesus Angleton’s *Baby’s First Guide American Foreign Policy* is fucking hilarious.

Moreover, when a population gets tired of having a boot on its neck, things get messy. The militarization of local police forces ensures that strength is met with strength.

I am not absolving those anarchists who committed crimes, or those criminals that seized opportunity to commit crimes, but rather pointing out that you can push people for just so long and then they push back.

Examples:
French Revolution 
Prague Spring
Watts in 65
Detroit in 67
Arab Spring of 11

Protests don’t always result in a revolution, or even an insurrection, but they always make those in charge, uncomfortable.

I sense you are uncomfortable.

(A stance the *Truman* administration supported, initially.)

Once again your pie-eyed view of “pushing the Shah to return” is so naive it borders on childlike.

The driving force behind the 1979 revolution was a swell of anti-Western sentiment, but to claim it was because of “moving people into cities” and “industrialization” is backward Orientalism masquerading as political insight, and the kind political perspective an idiot would glean from having their only perspective on Iran be a Larry The Cable Guy set from 2004.

Now you know that person does not like you, but when your buddy says that person just threatened to rape you. You realize thats not what the phrase really means. 

It does get more complicated than this as Persian also uses words to denote formality which is not really a thing in English, but you can kinda think of them as prefixes. I say this to clarify because unless specified you can approximate death to America is more like f\*ck your government, which is a sentiment most Americans share.  

But for added context the phrase Shut up in Iranian can be translated to choke in English.

Bruh....these people are attempting to tear down an entire Theocracy. They are going to be brutally murdered and probably raped when people aren't looking. This is their glory, this is their moment. Do not cry for their deaths, they knew they would probably die. And they went forward with their goals knowing that; not because they wanted people to feel sorry for them, or for Instagram clout. They did it because if they succeed, then decades from now when little girls and boys are looking at these tools of oppression in museums, they will see them as some relic from long ago, no longer a yolk of oppression they are forced to wear, but instead a small and terrible footnote in the pages of history, something that won't ever control them. 



These people are dying for a cause. For something they believe in so deeply, so unashamedly, that they are willing to lay down their lives...honestly, your tears do them an injustice. Do not cry for them. Instead, rage for them. Be angry at their killers and stand up for them. If there is a way for you to help them, then do so. They want change, not your tears, not your pity. They want freedom.


Don't cry for them because they are dead. Cheer for them because they were willing to do what was right when no one else would, even if it meant sacrificing everything. Cheer for them, because they are no longer willing to be victims, they are martyrs and heroes now.",1665251828.0

Even though I went to 12 years of catholic school and had very religious friends, I can’t understand the mindset of a “soldier of god”.

The “morality police” are literally killing little girls. This so called great theocracy feels threatened by teenage girls. It lays bare what their interpretation of religion really is…social control of thought and of women through a monopoly on violence.

I used to think that Iran was somewhat more progressive than most of the Middle East, but that’s because my understanding of it stopped in the 70’s.Also, there’s been a rejuvenation of religious extremists and authoritarians since the fall of the ussr..

I hope and believe that these are the last dying grasps of the old order as more and more people are beginning to think for themselves and not rely on religion for meaning. These assholes refuse to go quietly",1665310625.0

also the fact that if the iranian military did go all out on it’s people like you said, it’s likely another country will stand up to it. if the u.s. military went all out it would probably just be over. 

amany protests in iran have been squashed in silent before because the people literally cannot do anything. it’s not the military mobilizing their entire task force to stop these, it’s guys with guns. i don’t know if you’ve noticed but any iranian currently fighting says to keep them in the spotlight, to spread this on social media etc.

It's still a modern military. An armed populace still cannot beat a modern military, and that's *any* modern military, not just the literal strongest fighting force on the face of the earth. 

I'll say it again. *any* modern military will wipe the floor against a regular old armed populace. 

>a lot of enlisted soldiers are not on the side of the shah. if something broke out they would likely switch.

There's a pecking order for a reason. Even if the lower ranked folks don't agree with what's going on, the higher ranked folks are there to keep them in line. Mind you, I'm not saying it's impossible for there to be an internal military scuffle leading to proper civil war, but it's pretty unlikely. 

>if the iranian military did go all out on it’s people like you said, it’s likely another country will stand up to it.

Unlikely, very unlikely. To begin with, Iran already has a few international allies of it's own, so it would likely be the official government getting foreign aid, not the people. Second, Iran might not be the most popular country in the world, but there's a lot of other countries interested in maintaining the status quo. Remember what happened when Syria went tits up? ISIS was running around rampant, Al Qaeda resurfaced, heck, the ramifications of that civil war are still ongoing! No country wants more power vacuums in the middle east, and Iran is something of a powerhouse in the area already, fracturing it would not be in any countries interest. 

They would most likely simply turn a blind eye or at best, keep it to humanitarian aid. 

>it’s not the military mobilizing their entire task force to stop these, it’s guys with guns.

It's weird that you think adding guns doesn't just add a rung on the ladder. Current situation being people protest > men with guns show up and shoot them

What you're describing would be people protest > men with guns show up and shoot them > people shoot back > men with guns call for backup and men with bigger guns come to shoot the people into submission.  

What a great difference huh?

>you mentioned foreign aid, that’s exactly what they want, the problem is no one is giving it to them.

See aforementioned point. 

But we were never talking about arming people with foreign aid, we were talking about second amendment rights. That's what the very first parent comment was on about, and that's what I've been replying with in mind. An armed populace isn't worth jack shit. 

What they need is foreign aid. That wins uprisings. Otherwise the powers that be will simply keep wiping their ass with them, handgun or not.

>also i’m not even saying iran should have guns all the time like the united states, im just saying if they had guns right now it’d be way better

I hate Khomeini and his dictatorship more than anyone, but Iranis have been protesting for years and no one cared till now. Most of the people here don't know that the protests are more about changing the regime because it's been horrible (especially financially) the last few years. 

Iraq too, a couple of years ago it had protests where literally millions were on the streets marching against corruption and the Irani militias in Iraq, protestors were young and educated people and it was actually beautiful. But the media doesn't cover it because the current Iraqi gov is planed and supported by the U.S.

Again, I support what these brave women are doing and no gov is to say what they should wear, but reddit, being the hive mind it is, is supporting them for the wrong reasons.

I was so stressed, I kept crying to the lady to let me go. But she wont let go of my arm. There were also soldiers accompanying the morality police as well. I was so worried because my parents thought I was at my friends and I basically lied to them to go the mall and I was so scared that where they would take me or they would do to me☹️ I was lucky that I was able to pinch the lady's hand with my nails and free myself. She kept shouting "" come back"" at me while I was running away. I was able to hide myself in a store, in their fitting room and waited there till the police van was full and I could go out! PS: I was wearing my hijab and they didnt like that I had red lipstick on, with my bangs showing out my scarf (Of course I was 14 and I wanted to do make up and be a teenage) but it was definitely one of my worst memories that I have living in Iran dealing with morality police",1663871986.0

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia–United_States_relations

Excerpt: “ Saudi Arabia and the U.S. are strategic allies,[4][134] and since President Obama took office in 2009, the **U.S. has sold $110 billion in arms to Saudi Arabia.[135][136] The National Security Agency (NSA) in 2013 began cooperating with the Saudi Ministry of Interior in an effort to help ensure ""regime continuity"".** An April 2013 top secret memo shows the agency's program of providing ""direct analytic and technical support"" to the Saudis on ""internal security"" matters. **The CIA had already been gathering intelligence for the regime** long before.[137] “


Bush and the B\n L\d\n family have very close ties, **including starting an oil company together in 1978 (Arbusto Energy) and meeting together on 9/10/2001**: https://www.denverpost.com/2006/09/11/bush-ties-to-bin-laden-haunt-grim-anniversary/amp/

Around the same time, top officials Senator Graham and Rep Goss **were meeting with the one of the top financiers of the event**. Coincidence?: https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/04/us/trace-terror-congressional-hearings-rifts-plentiful-9-11-inquiry-begins-today.html
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmud_Ahmed



**In the past the US and it’s allies have openly handed several billions in arms to the Iranian regime**: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran–Contra_affair 

Excerpt: “In the spring of 1983, the United States launched Operation Staunch, a wide-ranging diplomatic effort to persuade other nations all over the world not to sell arms or spare parts for weapons to Iran.[17] This was at least part of the reason the Iran–Contra affair proved so humiliating for the United States when the story first broke in November 1986 that **the U.S. itself was selling arms to Iran**.”

“Iran was in the midst of the Iran–Iraq War and could find few Western nations willing to supply it with weapons.[37] The idea behind the plan was for Israel to ship weapons through an intermediary (identified as Manucher Ghorbanifar) to the Islamic Republic”

Excerpt: “""Israel [a U.S. ally] was interested in keeping the war between Iran and Iraq going to ensure that these two potential enemies remained preoccupied with each other."" 

“ A former ""high-level"" CIA official who saw reports of arms sales to Iran by Israel in the early 1980s estimated that the total was about $2 billion a year “ 

**Arguably speaking the regime wouldn’t have lasted until present day if it weren’t for that amount of support**, given that it had tactical domination over any non-regime-aligned groups.

Much of this is because released inmates are dumped back on the street with nothing, thus typically reliant on the same people in the same social networks that landed them in prison (this can even be parents or partners who are unwitting and well-meaning enablers). In many if not most countries there is little effort given to reintegrate them into society on any count, be it technology education, culture/political background information, or economic assistance.

To the point: What many people aren't familiar with is one of the other major drivers of recidivism - how difficult it can be to have a daily routine for *years*, strict structure and little choice etc, and then suddenly have complete freedom and not just control but responsibility for one's own care. Human autopilot is STRONG. Many (relative to zero, but a very small % of all) convicts have put themselves *back* in prison because they can't adapt to a world that's now 15 or 20 years later. Imagine going to prison with cassette tapes and rotary phones and now the very *idea* someone doesn't have a social media account is anathema.

I remember there was a 'burn your hijab and Quran and video it' challenge trending on Twitter a few years ago. Young women, many of them teens, were videoing themselves burning the Quran and their hijabs while saying ""I renounce and denounce Islam"" (in Arabic, obviously). Most of them were too terrified to show their faces, but there were a few who were brave. 

The problem with UK Marxists - which is what the hard-left in the UK are - is that they hate Israel (the slight irony here is that most of them are also Holocaust deniers). Because Palestine is Muslim, all Muslims are good, because Israel is Jewish, all Jews are bad. 

Jeremy Corbyn, their self-proclaimed leader (ex-Labour leader), has a penchant for Islamic terrorists (he is very friendly with many hate preachers who are banned from the UK, and Abu Hamza who's banged up in a jail in Colorado for the rest of his miserable existence). He supports both Hamas and Hezbollah (they're not terrorists, they're 'freedom fighters'). 

Anyway, anyone who shared one of these videos in solidarity with the rebellion was denounced as 'Islamophobic' and reported to Twitter for hate speech - because, apparently, the fact they were burning their hijabs and the Quran whilst simultaneously yelling ""I DENOUNCE AND RENOUNCE ISLAM!""...had nothing to do with Islam and it was ""hate speech"" to claim otherwise. 🙄🤦🏼‍♀️🤪. They also said the same about people who were sharing articles about protests similar to this where the militia were lining women up against walls and shooting them. Nothing to do with Islam. I remember being told ""How can you claim this is to do with Islam...? You can't say that - you're not Muslim!"". 

Nope, they're absolutely right, I'm not Muslim, I'm a white anti-theistic atheist. A white anti-theistic atheist who happens to believe that women are human beings with rights. I would say the same whatever the religion. The nationalistic Hindu government in India is oppressing anyone who isn't Hindu - I'll admit I'm not up to speed with the situation in India, but if Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists and those of no faith started being forced to adhere to Hindu customs, I would support them.

It originated in the medieval century from Christians who viewed all non-christians as infidels, and then got passed on via Mecca to Muhammad's vocabulary. In addition, Hell is *not* the blessed love of the creator, nor is it a pleasant place to reside. Most often it is described as 'fire' (Al-nar) as in the following verses:""...fear the Fire whose fuel is men and stones,- which is prepared for those who reject Faith"" (2:24).""...Enough is Hell for a burning fire. Those who reject Our Signs, We shall soon cast into the Fire...

A Fire blazing fiercely!"" (101:8-11).""In front of such a one is Hell, and he is given, for drink, boiling fetid water"" (14:16).

War, in this context, is also referred to as 'Jahid', which translates to 'fight against' and 'struggle against', both of which, within context of the policy of leniency and the relaxation, as well as the prior hesitancy to make enemies out of the people, exemplify the policy of violence against infidels.

With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people. 48 Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: “The one I kiss is the man; arrest him.” 49 Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” and kissed him.50 Jesus replied, “Do what you came for, friend.”\[d\]Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus and arrested him. 51 With that, one of Jesus’ companions reached for his sword, drew it out and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.52 “Put your sword back in its place,” Jesus said to him, “for all who draw the sword will die by the sword. 53 Do you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels? 54 But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way?”

Ephesians 6:12 states:12 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood (i.e. fellow man), but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.

Iran only just started forcing women to their ultrasounds before an abortion when we've been doing that in America for decades.

Thats what you've been told, and maybe in isolation one could buy it, but add in other facets of the control girls and women have when it comes to social and sexual life it all adds up to womens value being that of marriage rather than their autonomy.  Just think about it in a wider context, including that of 'honour killings'.

>Why don't jewish and christian nuns get the same treatment from the west? 

Jewish women, particularly in more orthodox sects most definitely do, but I would agree that christianity has (largely) moved on, though very conservative christian sects do hold very oppressive rules for girls/women.

>If you go through the Quran and Prophet Muhammad's (pbuh) life you'll find how much women are highly regarded. 

Sure, and I think this is where religion and culture make things somewhat messy.  Also, you can respect and highly regard while also impose oppressive conditions on existence.  Much like abusers say ""I love you so much I can't bear you to go anywhere without me""

>in fact, normalizing taking advantage of women and having complete freedom sleeping with whoever you want is how the west objectifys them. Which is bad for both genders, that's why ""open minded"" countries have significantly more divorce rates, rapes, porn addiction...etc

Prevention of penile problems. Occasionally, the foreskin on an uncircumcised penis can be difficult or impossible to retract (phimosis). This can lead to inflammation of the foreskin or head of the penis.

Yet. 

There's a whole research on how as soon as they hit that sweet spot of 5% of population they get really pushy. 

Found it: 

When the Muslim population remains under 2% in a country, they will be seen primarily as a peace-loving minority and not as a threat to other citizens. This is the current situation in:  
United States — Muslim 0.6%  
Australia — Muslim 1.5%  
Canada — Muslim 1.9%  
China — Muslim 1.8%  
Italy — Muslim 1.5%  
Norway — Muslim 1.8%  
As the Muslim population reaches 2% to 5%, they begin to recruit from ethnic minorities and disaffected groups, within prisons and street gangs. This is happening in:  
Denmark — Muslim 2%  
Germany — Muslim 3.7%  
United Kingdom — Muslim 2.7%  
Spain — Muslim 4%  
Thailand — Muslim 4.6%  
“From 5% on, they exercise an inordinate influence in proportion to their percentage of the population,” Dr. Hammond notes. “For example, they will push for the introduction of halal (clean by Islamic standards) food” and increase pressure on supermarket chains to feature such food on their shelves — along with threats for failure to comply. This is happening in:  
France — Muslim 8%  
Philippines — 5%  
Sweden — Muslim 5%  
Switzerland — Muslim 4.3%  
The Netherlands — Muslim 5.5%  
Trinidad & Tobago — Muslim 5.8%  
Soon they begin to apply pressure to allow Sharia law within their own communities (sometimes ghettos).  
“When Muslims approach 10% of the population, they tend to increase lawlessness as a means of complaint about their conditions,” Dr. Hammond notes. “In Paris, we are already seeing car-burnings. Any non-Muslim action offends Islam, and results in uprisings and threats, such as in Amsterdam, with opposition to Mohammed cartoons and films about Islam.” These tensions are seen on a regular basis in:  
Guyana — Muslim 10%  
India — Muslim 13.4%  
Israel — Muslim 16%  
Kenya — Muslim 10%  
Russia — Muslim 15%  
The violence increases when the Muslim population reaches 20%. “After reaching 20%, nations can expect hair-trigger rioting, jihad militia formations, sporadic killings, and the burnings of Christian churches and Jewish synagogues,” such as in:  
Ethiopia — Muslim 32.8%  
At 40%, nations experience widespread massacres, chronic terror attacks, and ongoing militia warfare,” such as in:  
Bosnia — Muslim 40%  
Chad — Muslim 53.1%  
Lebanon — Muslim 59.7%  
From 60%, persecution of non-believing “infidels” rises significantly, including sporadic ethnic cleansing (genocide), use of Sharia law as a weapon, and Jizya, a tax placed on infidels, such as in:  
Albania — Muslim 70%  
Malaysia — Muslim 60.4%  
Qatar — Muslim 77.5%  
Sudan — Muslim 70%  
After 80%, expect daily intimidation and violent jihad, some State-run ethnic cleansing, and even some genocide, as these nations drive out “infidels,” and move toward a 100% Muslim society, which has been experienced to some degree in:  
Bangladesh — Muslim 83%  
Egypt — Muslim 90%  
Gaza — Muslim 98.7%  
Indonesia — Muslim 86.1%  
Iran — Muslim 98%  
Iraq — Muslim 97%  
Jordan — Muslim 92%  
Morocco — Muslim 98.7%  
Pakistan — Muslim 97%  
Palestine — Muslim 99%  
Syria — Muslim 90%  
Tajikistan — Muslim 90%  
Turkey — Muslim 99.8%  
United Arab Emirates — Muslim 96%  
A 100% Muslim society will theoretically usher in their version of peace — the peace of ‘Dar-es-Salaam’ — the Islamic House of Peace. “Here there’s supposed to be peace, because everybody is a Muslim, the Madrassas are the only schools, and the Koran is the only word,” such as in:  
Afghanistan — Muslim 100%  
Saudi Arabia — Muslim 100%  
Somalia — Muslim 100%  
Yemen — Muslim 100%  
“Unfortunately, peace is never achieved, as in these 100% states the most radical Muslims intimidate and spew hatred & satisfy their blood lust by killing less radical Muslims, for a variety of reasons.”",1663798875.0

You should be ashamed of yourselves. Wouldn't you be embarrassed for *God* to see you like that?!"" So A&E promptly clothe themselves in leaves. Then God comes back, and his first question is, ""Why are you hiding yourselves?"" They tell him, ""Because we were naked. Super embarrassing."" And God says...""Who told you *that*? Oh, that serpent over there? Tsk, that guy is such a liar!""...and promptly banishes Satan from the garden for having told such an egregious lie.

iph297m,pics,"Those are some nice baseless assumptions you've made there, how very Redditor of you.

First, the US medical industry is pro-profit, as evidenced by it being called an industry over there and not a service, making ANY medical study conducted on whether or not a procedure is necessary dubious at best. 

Second, using the available stats I have (3.66 million births in 2021 at a pretty much bang on 50/50 split, so 1.83 million males, circumcision at a rate of 81% and an average price between 150 and 400 USD, using a median of 275 dollars for an average result), you have approx. 1.48 million circumcisions, which multiplied by the price comes out to 407 MILLION dollars, which are not small chips by anyone's metric. It makes sense, then, that an American research facility would publish a paper touting the usefulness and efficacy of an unnecessary procedure, as they don't want to see their wallets take a hit.

Third, the rates are a simple matter of observation. In the US, Viagra and things akin to it are heavily advertised, whereas I've never seen it anywhere but in a condom machine in a pub toilet. Were it that much of an issue, would we not hear about it much more often? We DO get ads for non prescription drugs over here, after all. If there was any money to be made out of it all, they'd advertise it more. Simple as.

Fourth, how fucking ironic that you baselessly and brazenly suggest that I am an anti-vaxxer conspiracy theorist, when the US is the nation the anti-vaxxer movement STARTED IN, and was caused by a bogus study someone made to discredit injection based inoculation so he could make money off of his own method.

Khomeini was a very useful tool to destabilize Iran and mitigate soviet influence in the oil rich country. There is an often ignored series of BBC and other reports on how the US helped the mullahs hijack the socialist revolution in Iran in 1979, after a long history of the Anglo-Soviet invasion and Operation Ajax removing Iran's monarch and democratic leaders each time they tried to nationalize their oil, and the Shah as per his famous 60 minutes interviews where he calls or western manipulation and oil nationalization was destined for a similar fate. It has been international foreign policy for a long time to create and maintain corrupt dictatorships or extremists in resource rich countries, and it is very difficult for ordinary people to overthrow them when the regime has been implicitly supported in power by both eastern and western superpowers over the years. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter%27s_engagement_with_Ruhollah_Khomeini

Cause whenever the situation in Iran is talked about somebody who doesn't really know what they are talking about brings up the one factoid they do know about as if it's all encompassing. Yes, the United States and other Western powers supposed the Shah of Iran in being restored to his throne (not installed, restored) in a conflict with his then Prime Minster Mohammad Mosaddegh. 

But lets talk about the comparison of the Iranian Revolutionary governments (post 1979) torture to that of the Shah of Iran (1953-1979). [See Human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_the_Islamic_Republic_of_Iran).

I specifically quote this so that you get an idea of which government was worse. As this account is from somebody who was tortured by both of them:

>The Islamic revolution is thought to have a significantly worse human rights record than the Pahlavi Dynasty it overthrew. According to political historian Ervand Abrahamian, ""whereas less than 100 political prisoners had been executed between 1971 and 1979, more than 7900 were executed between 1981 and 1985. ... the prison system was centralized and drastically expanded ... Prison life was drastically worse under the Islamic Republic than under the Pahlavis. One who survived both writes that four months under [warden] Ladjevardi took the toll of four years under SAVAK. In the prison literature of the Pahlavi era, the recurring words had been 'boredom' and 'monotony'. In that of the Islamic Republic, they were 'fear', 'death', 'terror', 'horror', and most frequent of all 'nightmare' ('kabos').

Also, in case anyone wants to know, the number one big crime committed by the Shah, according to the Ayatollahs, is that he allowed former Prime Minster Mohammad Mosaddegh to  live after he was ousted from power. The Shah didn't just have Mosaddegh killed by having large stones thrown at him. Instead the Shah allowed Mosaddegh to have a house-arrest retirement where he was otherwise ignored. But the religious leadership couldn't allow for that. Their number one complaint against the Shah was that the Shah was not overly brutal and evil enough. They wanted a political leader who murdered people from small grievances and errors.

I don't think this is going to get through to too many people, but figured I'd try.",1666393754.0

It doesn’t protect women, it puts a mark on them 

it creates this dichotomy where women are see as pure vs sluts and nothing in between, it makes people judge women by what they wear 

The whole wrapped candy analogy was started because of Hijab 

It creates this culture of victim blaming, the constant comparison between women, slut-shaming of non-hijabi women and considering them not suitable for marriage, violent crimes against hijabi women in the west 

And worst of all 

The hijab was originally intended to separate free women from slave women and the slave women were forced to show their breast and if they covered them, they would get punished 

If hijab is supposed to be for protection, then why were the slaves not allowed to wear it 

There is nothing good about it, it has so many disadvantages

I'm sorry but that's not true. Eliminating the hijab won't eliminate slut shaming. It won't eliminate the history of the hijab. To say the hijabi's won't suffer is just false because those who wear it by choice will lose something that holds significant ideological and spiritual meaning to them. The vast majority of hijabis don't know it's origins. It's just the way they worship their God. They have a huuuge attachment to it. Being forced to remove that could be traumatic. Not just that it's a dig at their religion, it's a dig and their religion and ability to control their clothing. What women wear should ALWAYS only be up to the woman, and if she wants to listen to misogynistic dogma, than she should have the freedom to do that. People should be allowed to make bad decisions. It's a piece of fabric for Gods sake. 

Not to mention how do you even police that? Rip clothes off women as they walk down the street? Or arrest them, and in the process of arresting them, force them to take it off? Why is it always us women who have to suffer the oppression of others deciding what we wear? Do you think someone forcefully taking away something that is significant to you is any less oppressive than having someone shove it on you? It's the same thing, man. I wouldn't want my mother or my sister to be forced to remove their hijab because I know how much it would agonise them despite me wanting to burn mine. 

Also, a hijab ban wouldn't mean the hijabi women would be walking without the hijab. It would mean they would no longer be allowed to even leave the house. And hell, some would choose to stay inside the house than leave by choice! People really, really believe in this stuff. I've seen women get *hysterical* over their hijab falling off. When I had it on by choice before losing the faith, *I* would have gotten hysterical. Dude my parents already don't let me leave the house if they percieve something to be wrong with my dress, with a hijab ban they *literally would not let me leave the house dude.* Can you imagine the amount of Muslim women who would lose their education over this? Already their are women who are stopped from being treated due to the doctors being male. Can you imagine how many women would be forced or opt to die at home rather than expose themselves without hijab in order to get much needed medical attention? Or how many would not have access to necessary equipment? 

Telling women what and what not to wear is never the answer. Educating women about the truth behind the hijab and empowering them so they are able to leave abusive situations is. And maybe not all women will agree with you but that's none of anybody's business.",1663714281.0

> The two protesters who entered the embassy&#039;s grounds were detained, according to police in the Swiss capital.

> Thousands of Iranians have taken to the streets over the last two weeks in protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who had been detained by the morality police in the capital, Tehran, for allegedly wearing her mandatory Islamic headscarf too loosely.

That being said, I'd argue that this is not really about Islam. It's about a corrupt bunch, twisting the religion into their favour at every opportunity.   
It's more so about people having the freedom to act within Islam as they wish, and to have a freedom of religion, culture and tradition. And to have a freedom to voice their concerns without getting beaten and killed in the streets.  
I am however very wary about outsider intervention. The last thing I want is a country from the West jumping in to ruin our country just as they did with Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria.

You probably know that Iran is a big country with 85 million people in a very strategic location, with extraordinary resources and a terrible reputation in the global scene as it's ruled by an absolute theocracy. The success of Iranian protests and toppling the regime will not only boost the local economy and vastly improve the life of Iranian people, but will open up an entirely new partnership to the west, and seriously weaken the dominance of China and Russia over the region. Not to mention that it could very well cause Syria, Yemen, Lebanon, Iraq and Afghanistan to follow suit and that could potentially result in a finally stable and prosperous middle east, which for one will vastly improve the economy of the region and the humanitarian crisis that has been going on for years.

Moreover, the government of Iran is a major actor in supporting global terrorism. With a democratic Iran, that will be an ally to the west, much of the taxpayer money wasted on conflicts and killings over there can be rerouted to be spent on Canadians such as yourself!",1664701565.0

https://www.npr.org/2019/01/31/690363402/how-the-cia-overthrew-irans-democracy-in-four-days

> On Aug. 19, 2013, the CIA publicly admitted for the first time its involvement in the 1953 coup against Iran's elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh.



> The documents provided details of the CIA's plan at the time, which was led by senior officer Kermit Roosevelt Jr., the grandson of U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt. Over the course of four days in August 1953, Roosevelt would orchestrate not one, but two attempts to destabilize the government of Iran ...

> After months of talks the prime minister broke off negotiations and denied the British any further involvement in Iran's oil industry. Britain then appealed to the United States for help, which eventually led the CIA to orchestrate the overthrow of Mossadegh and restore power to Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran ...

> According to Stephen Kinzer, author of the book All the Shah's Men, Roosevelt quickly seized control of the Iranian press by buying them off with bribes and circulating anti-Mossadegh propaganda.

She has run into trouble before with the police for being outspoken, so she can't live there. She told me that when she was a girl, in her early teens and attending school that she started to grow a mustache, you know light peach fuzz, and she has black hair, and obviously she hated it.  

Apparently the culture according to her family was she was not allowed to remove it until she was married.   
Get your head around that for a minute.  

She hated her walks to and from school each day because she was regularly ridiculed my men heckling her on the street calling her a ""little monkey'.

Anyway, she hated the mustache, so, she got some money together and got it waxed off.  Her teacher was the first person to notice, and she was aghast, sending my friend home from school immediately, she was only to be allowed back when the mustache had grown back.  Her mother managed with judicious use of make-up to disguise what her daughter had done, because if her father had seen it she would undoubtedly been beaten.

After a while it grew back and she went back to school.  The mother and daughter kept the truth from the father by telling him that she had female uterine issues that caused her pain.
 

No wonder people don't want to live in such bullshit.

irpus74,worldnews,"For the ME, and especially compared to the current regime, the shah was pretty benevolent. He wasn't exactly an angel but no ruler is. For example the Shah famously avoided imprisoning or executing Khomeini despite being an obvious threat, because of the respect he had for Shia clerics (who he mistakenly thought would take his side against communists). The level of political imprisonment under the Shah's regime was pretty miniscule and vastly overblown compared to what happened in even just the first two years of the IR. The severe punishments inflicted in Iranian prisons during the Shah's rule weren't invented by him, they were a relic of ancient practices in Iran like *falak* (whipping the soles of convicts' feet so that they couldn't walk for weeks/months and had to shamefully crawl everywhere) which was a *minor* punishment; impalement and disembowelment were common punishments in the Qajar era for instance. The Shah actually worked to decrease physical punishments and shift towards a more psychological style of interrogation, similar to what the CIA did. Of course this is still bad, but it's no worse than happens in places like the USA. Which for the ME is outstanding.

In Japan the emperor is the leader of the religion and believed to be descended from Amaterasu. The Japanese Emperor still exists today because he is the leader of Buddhism in Japan. In China the emperor operated on a ""mandate from the gods"". Dynasties fell in the past usually because of the belief and rallying cry that the ruling party was no longer following the will of the Gods. These are traditions only recently abolished after World War 2.

In Muslim countries they all follow a tradition of government established by Muhammad, the founder of Islam and leader of Arabia. It is a foreign concept to separate religion and government in Islam.

The Roman Empire operated under the concept of ""Caesar over Pope"". This is not to say that Caesar was non-secular. To the contrary Julius Caesar was both dictator and Pontifex Maximus, the religious leader of Roman Paganism. His heir Augustus Caesar would also be both the religious leader as well as Emperor. This continues to Constantine where he would reunify the empire by combining Paganism and Christianity into the orthodox church.

It isn't until Charlemagne when he would take control of the Western Roman Empire by arranging an agreement with the Pope; where the Pope would recognize him as Emperor in exchange for and agreement that the Pope would not have to answer to the Emperor. This is the foundation on the separation of Church and State which the French Revolution would expand upon with a secular government that western countries observe today.

My cousin was killed by the shah for owning a book and being against the regime.

Khomeini spent years stoking the flames of anti-west sentiment and inflated the shah's death count in order to get the revolution going.

If one is a member of the church when the year begins, they will pay taxes for the whole year. Studies show that church membership resignations in Finland are mainly due to the general secularization of society, not because of tax avoidance.[8]

Okay, so the only metric by whether or not an authoritarian leader is bad is by their death count? Not how they imprisoned and tortured those that disagree with their regime? He sent people away for life sentences for opposing him.

He didn't just leave. There was a massacre in Jaleh square. Martial law was declared. The shah had 100 of his own officials arrested.

In reality it was way more complicated and the mullahs had a far bigger role in ousting him than any plot by the US or Britain.

Just so we're clear, the shah was reinstated after the U.S./CIA and British/MI6 overthrew Mossadegh. The shah was propped up by the west to keep him in power. Khomeini stoked anti-U.S. and western sentiments which was a direct shot to the sentiment surrounding Reza. These anti-western sentiments helped fuel the revolution.

I'm not a regime propagandist. Khomeini was undoubtedly worse (1979 coup and on) but there were valid reasons why the Iranian people wanted a change of leadership.

They do not hate their government as much as Iranians do because of how much MBS has opened their country compared to before. 

You can see from my post when I said open, I mean compared to their previous government. Before MBS, the morality police used to take women off the street and beat them and jail them for putting the Hijab wrong or mixing genders in outings. There were no concerts, movie theatres were banned, and you couldn't do anything that involved mixed genders (even restaurants were segregated by gender).

MBS came and he removed the power of the morality police. Now they aren't allowed to do anything and the police jail the morality police if they go out of line. He also suspended the requirement of Hijab, so now women don't have to wear it. He also permitted mixing of genders in restaurants and other places, which is something Saudis never thought would ever happen. Then he introduced concerts and movie theatres, also something Saudis never imagined they would ever get. 

Yes he is a horrible dictator as I've said and still a psychopath, but compared to the previous government, he has opened Saudi so much for the population that they are extremely happy with the progress. Sure he is still jailing dissenters and protesters, but before you couldn't protest and you couldn't even go to a movie theatre with your friends. Now you still can't protest, but you can go to a movie theatre and enjoy life like they've never enjoyed before. To the Saudi people, this is a great step forward and they love him for it. 

You will never understand how the Saudis feel because you don't live in an opressive regime. They understand they can't criticise the government, but now they feel like they can breathe and live life like they never thought possible. 

The difference between Saudi and Iran is MBS realized you can keep controlling the population as long as you open up slowly and do small gestures that keep the people happy. Keep the population complacent and they won't riot. Iran did the complete opposite and is closing down more and more, when Iranians were more free before.

This is untrue, at least kind of.

After the Shahs Western backed coup against Mosaddegh in 1953, a new political program was implemented in 1963, the White Revolution. The program aimed for the modernisation of Iran around the core of Persian traditions in the fields of economy, society and politics. However, womens issues didn’t play an huge role on the political agenda for at least a decade after the coup.

Now, one important improvement were electoral rights and in the post that was linked here it sounded like having no suffrage means a country or society is backwards. While that may be so in the Wests public and/ or widespread perception, but if we want to go down that road as an indicator of modernity, then again, let’s not forget that in respected members of the Western world such as Switzerland and Liechtenstein, women weren’t allowed to vote either until 1971/ 1984.

Besides electoral rights, women were allowed to get an education and their opportunities to do so expanded significantly. More over, they could mingle freely with men. Modernisation also meant westernisation to the Shah, so there were women on billboards in bikinis in public, or public beaches or public pools without segregation between men and women. For Iranian women, politics became also a field they could engage in, as the existence of several womens rights organisations prove. It didn’t hurt, that the Shahs sister was a member of one off these organisations and therefore could exert some influence on her brother. So these organisations advocated and lobbied for suffrage, and in February 1962, six women were elected as members. Women remained members until the abolishment of the parliament by the Shah. Women were allowed to work as judges, ambassadors, civil servants and in the police and other places in the workforce. There were daycare centres to help women being able to join the workforce, for family planning there was abortion and birth control for women. There was no segregation at universities or in public life, hair salons for instance. Moreover, women were allowed to chose their field of study. Until the Revolution, womens rights made small but steady progress and were widened little by little. According to Nashat, women never had more rights and opportunities in Iran than in the times before the Islamic Revolution.

Protest against Westernisation, suffrage and womens rights came from Khomeini. The veil had been abolished officially in 1936 and now the Shah outlawed the hijab from public live and instead advocated for western dresscodes and he very strongly insisted that public service employees should do the same. But in general, people and especially women dressed more in a western way. The dissent on this matter was a generational and regional one: The younger Iranians didn’t mind the hijab legislation that much, as did Iranians in the urban regions and in the northern parts. Older people and rather southern parts, however, took a very different stance on that issue. Women who didn’t want to follow the legislation and wear hijab stayed home, meaning rich religious women stayed home, poor ones had to obey the law and leave their home without hijab. So, in a way, women had the right to choose, but not the right to choose in certain aspects of life. In fact, in todays Iran, you’ll still meet more open (in a modern and/or Western sense) Iranians in the north or the big cities, whereas the ones in the south match the cliché of the traditional backward Muslims. Unfortunately, the Shah understood modernisation as westernisation and he oppressed both political and religious opposition with the SHAVAK, the secret police.

Modernisation had not only meant economy and infrastructure, but also society. While in general wealth grew, not everyone profited and corruption was an issue. Yes, the rich got richer and only a few of the poor made substantial improvements in their life’s. That applied also to women, those especially in traditionalist regions and environments couldn’t access those rights. Also, not everyone could afford to exercise every right. But some were (almost) free - like free choice of seating in public transport, sitting in one classroom with boys and getting the same (at least) basic education and higher education if you belonged to the (growing) middle classe or upwards, or a drink in a public pools restaurant with men. Women didn’t have to be afraid to be reported to the morality police for inappropriate or un-Islamic behaviour. Furthermore, after the Revolution, womens rights were revoked, especially those regarding divorce, public life or marriage (think of age etc.).

Was it progressive in regards to womens lives in comparison to Western standards? No, it wasn’t really on the same level at all. It was more patriarchal than western society’s. But, and this is key, women, in general, were more free before the Islamic Revolution.

Historically-speaking, that was kinda necessary in the latter 19th and early 20th centuries given the country, provinces, and many cities and services were largely run by Protestants who had a hard-on for discriminating against then-minority Catholics (especially those Irish and French Canadian Catholics).  From 1834 to 1955 Toronto had nothing but Protestant mayors, many of whom were members of the Orange Order.  Hamilton didn't elect its first Catholic mayor until 1962, who immediately pissed off the city's Protestant elite by banning the Orange Order parade.  Even when the odd Catholic mayor, Premier, or Prime Minister held office, much of the political establishment, economic elite, etc were Protestants.

I don't think there's really a place for a publicly-funded separate Catholic school system anymore, but I get why it was protected in the first place.  Also, getting rid of it now would be a big pain in the backside of any provincial government trying to change it, but I think support for change has been growing in the last couple decades and it may happen eventually.",1665329929.0

Another 3,000 people, it is thought, died in a 1963 uprising, and 5,000 during the revolution that ousted the shah. Altogether, the deaths from 1963 to the shah's exile in January 1979 come to perhaps 10,000, an estimate endorsed by Butler of the ICJ.

I don't know if they did know any better, or if they simply did not see separation of church and state as important.  They weren't ""enlightened"" figures in that respect. The Fathers of Confederation did not look south for inspiration when they sought to create Canada, and did not look too favourably upon the United States, but rather they took inspiration from across the ocean, as they viewed Canada as an extension of Britain rather than a fully-independent country.  

In any case, I do think the tide is tuning against support for the separate school systems.  Like you said, other provinces have removed them, but I think there'd still be fight in Ontario and elsewhere against it.  That said, I think it would be less of a fight to remove public funding for Catholic schools today than there would have been 10 or 20 years ago, and in 10-15 years' time it could very well happen without so much as a whimper.

I am saying you can be right for the wrong reasons. People who use a rational model of morality can reach the idea that adultery is wrong and explain why. Christians would just say, “It’s wrong cause the book says so!” And this is why we have issues, because there is no critical thinking or understanding of the real issues behind what is “right” or “wrong” when you base your entire moral and legal system on religion.

That is also what allows bad people to take advantage of religion to do terrible things, like the Iranians or like the catholic schools in Canada.

But it does provide a much stronger hedge against those things than morality and laws based solely on religion.

I am not making ""arbitrary rules"" and I challenge you to point out any rule I even made, let alone whether it is ""arbitrary.""

irn6pkp,worldnews,"I'm going to say two things here.

First, again, people who follow religious morals can be easily manipulated by religious leaders. You may argue that Christian groups largely pushed welfare programs at the local or state levels at one point in American history. Sure, and we'll even ignore that the Social Security Act and great society programs were all pushed on a rational basis to combat endemic poverty in the US, not religious. But what happened starting in 1969? In the US, that's when Christians did a 180-degree turn from supporting welfare to completely and outright rejecting all forms of welfare, which they still do today. If Christians *today* had full power in the US, we would have no Social Security, no unemployment benefits, no SNAP food program, they'd cast the poor out to die and say they deserve it. 

Why? Because they've been easily manipulated over the years by their own religious leaders and by politicians who lie under the banner of religion. Because they have no critical thinking skills. It doesn't matter to them that their religion in practice no longer follows the actual principles of their book. They simply do as their told because they can't think for themselves on complex issues, because they don't understand *why* they believe what they believe.

Second, religion has been a vital tool for global society to progress. We would not have been able to come this far without it, despite its flaws. It is still a good tool for community and existential comfort today. But in the world of law and morality (which informs law), we have grown up to the point where it is a net detractor. It is no longer necessary and it cannot be used as a basis for legislation when everyone has differing or no religion.

I think functionally, whatever the intent was, if you have a critical analysis of history, 1. The net effect on the native population was about the same - cultures wiped out except for small enclaves and reservations, and mass-deaths. The intermixing was mostly natives taken willingly or forcibly as wives because only the richest could bring over women. 2. Slavery was just as horrific in all of the locations and included many of the same abuses - beatings, mutilation, rape, separation of families and terrible working conditions. And Brazil had just about half of all slaves imported to the Americas, so the extent of the slavery is on the level of every other country in the western hemisphere ***combined.***

So no, the Spanish and Portuguese were NOT kinder, more gentle or nicer than the British or the French. Just different.

You bring up politicians as an example on the Democratic side. But you are missing at least two key points. The first is that Democrats, while claiming to be religious, also *don't talk constantly about how their religious values inform their policy, and in fact they claim the contrary.* In comparison, their opponents *do*.

The second is that a lot of politicians claim to be Christian for electoral purposes only but are not practicing or actual believers. [The A-word is only second to the S-word in terms unpopularity among the electorate.](https://news.gallup.com/poll/254120/less-half-vote-socialist-president.aspx) Considering Democrats mostly cater towards conservative-lites in swing states, and those people are mostly religious, it is little surprise that many candidates - I guess including Republicans like Donald Trump even - would lie about being religious for votes.

According to who? It literally says they were non-violent.

You're twisting shit around because you made the claim that only terrorists and seditionists we're imprisoned by the shah. Give it up. Reporters, teachers and the like are not terrorists.

>>Khomeini was in exile and not imprisoned by the shah. You're grasping hard

For only about 6 months.

You're legitimately trying to lump Khomeni into the teachers, artists, and non-violent others that were imprisoned by the shah to make this weird twisted argument:

>Khamenei, Rafsanjani and other terrorists like them were the ones who had other jobs beside their activities.

They are not including Khomeini and Rafsanjani into these ""other job"" people.

You're trying to discredit normal non-violent outspoken critics of the regime by lumping actual terrorists into the group.

Your original argument that the shah only imprisoned terrorists and seditionists has been blown to pieces.

The world at large does not care about Iran and as such, the autocratic regime can kill and imprison the citizens with impunity. By keeping the spotlight on what they are doing, it puts pressure on the regime. It's much easier to commit crimes in the dark. Do not let them.

The movement is growing day by day. This is the biggest protest movement in Iran for decades, possibly centuries. This is the first time since the Islamic Republic seized power that there are protests in 31 out of 31 provinces.

A couple kids scooped up small rocks and casually tossed them at her head. An old woman squatted and lifted a larger stone with both hands, heaving it dispassionately onto the young woman’s body, and spitting at her. There wasn’t any yelling, or visible signs of outrage. The people looked strangely automatic about the affair. Like dropping bus tokens into the pot, without acknowledging the driver. The backstory was that the girl had been meeting with a young man from the village, and had been judged as impure. I don’t know where it was, although it appeared to be somewhere in the Middle East.

However, they have never ever been as big. This is the first time that 31 out of 31 provinces have protests. The 2009 Green movement only had protests in 6 provinces, mostly in the larger cities. 

Also, we have not seen the protestors be this fearless en masse. Never in my life have I seen images and videos of people ripping up and stamping out the supreme leader’s image. That is a crime punishable by death. 

It is no longer just about women’s rights, but about all of the ways the corrupt Islamic regime has failed and oppressed Iranians. Women are the absolute leaders of this movement, but the men are backing them up and supporting them in ways I haven’t seen or expected. 

I’ve also never seen so many non-Iranians talk about this or frankly care. These stories are usually only things me and my family know about and discuss. The internet and the exposure is making a difference. 

**This is the one movement where posting on the internet is true activism**. We cannot send money to Iran because of sanctions, but we can support them in making sure they and the government know we are watching. It is much harder for the regime to kill us in the dark. 

I’m an Iranian in the diaspora and I’ve never seen anything like this. No movement has lasted this long or been this large. I am equal parts terrified, hopeful, proud, and anxious. 

Please do what you can to talk about this movement and keep it alive. Discuss it with your friends and family, post online, reach out to any Iranian you know and check on them.

 >A series of nationwide civil protests in Iran, sometimes known as Bloody November or (using the Iranian calendar) Bloody Aban (Persian: آبان خونین) took place in 2019 and 2020. Initially caused by a 50–200% increase in fuel prices, they occurred as part of the wider Iranian Democracy Movement, leading to calls for the overthrow of the government in Iran and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. The protests commenced as peaceful gatherings on the evening of 15 November but spread to 21 cities within hours, as videos of the protest circulated online,  eventually becoming the most violent and severe anti-government unrest since the rise of Iran's Islamic Republic in 1979.

There are different definitions of rape in Islamic law, and raping a wife of a sham marriage isn't a death penalty in sharia law.

>If you're going to claim that rape happened because of Islam when Islam has a very extreme stance against rape it's gonna be controversial because of how ridiculously illogical that claim is.

When people living in Western democracies tell people of other cultures that their way of life is wrong and they should embrace secularism, socialism and atheism, people on the other side—who histories include having lived through the effects of colonialism through the Columbine Exchange, the Scramble for Africa, and the Great Game into Asia—sees these comments as just another form of white power, “carrying God’s burden” demagogue.

In other words, they’ll double down on their conservatism and probably inspire another terrorist to attack America again.

What the conversation should be like, instead, is ask a group of people on the other side, if they like to see their daughters murdered by the state because they wore wrongly. I bet that the one guy who proudly said, “Yes,” gets the stink eye by the others, and we’ll probably see the guy in some depraved video-driven subreddit that scream, “having leopards eating their faces.”

People from cultures that never went through the Protestant Reformation—and therefore were not expose to a time where a religious authority was outright challenged so famously so as to spark the German duchies to revolt against their Holy Roman Emperor, the British to create their own church, and spark the many wars leading up to the creation of The Netherlands, and the eventual settlement of the Westphalian peace that gave us the very notion of what it means to be a nation, a country, and a sovereign territory—will never understand the ideas for secularism, atheism and socialism, all of which came down as a consequence of the Renaissance and the Industrial Revolution, both of which we could never thought of, if the Reformation hadn’t come into being.

We should hold leaders and followers accountable absolutely, but religion itself is not fundamentally evil. I should expand on this by separating the thing being worshipped (faith) from the organised people choosing how to follow it (religion), as both are lumped into the term ""religion"" for simplicity. We all do this, it's easy and I don't blame anyone. ""Faith"" in any certain belief is not inherently bad, but religion can be depending on what it's causing/ what's being done in its name. 


Also, I respectfully think people who think Muslims follow ""Sharia Law"" need to learn more about Islam before criticising it. Sharia roughly translates to ""the divine idea of justice"", as in, this is what Muslims strive for but can never truly have because humans are flawed creatures and Sharia is perfection. ""Fiq"" (pronounced fick) is what Muslim legal code actually is and what Muslims follow. This is why there are so many different schools of thought in the Islamic world, they all differ on how they should use Fiq to try to most closely reach Sharia. When pollers and reporters ask Muslims if they believe in Sharia, there are some who will understand what's actually being asked, but many think you're just asking them if we should have pure, perfect justice that isn't tainted by human flaw.

Only around the time of colonialism did more  fundamentalist views like Salafism (original of Saudi Arabia's faith, Wahhabism) start becoming more popular. Why? Because these people have been under foreign rule and progress was suppressed, leading to reactionaries saying the right things to convince people to follow them against the tyrannical yoke of imperialists, giving these more hard-line conservative interpretations of Islam more credibility in the eyes of the Muslim world. 


Europe wasn't the colonised, so stuff like the Enlightenment could happen, leading to more medieval ideas of Christianity being replaced with more progressive takes becoming the norm.

The fundamental principles in both are that elected positions are held solely to represent policy decisions already made through direct democracy, with no actual power residing in the position. Power structures are kept flat, and most policy discussions take place at the level of a neighborhood meeting, a trade union, a women's council, or a local self-defense militia, before the issues discussed there are brought by a representative to the representatives of other groups for consultation, and the conclusions from that consultation are then brought back to that basic level where the actual decisions are again made through direct democracy.

But left (which is generally atheist politic leaning) are pushing for banning pronouns and banning ""hate speech' currently? and of course Stalin example. You would argue it stems from lack of ideology, I will argue that they just haven't given much time to do so, because humans are generally the same whether religious or not. 

Also studies has been done showing that average charitable donation is much higher among the Muslim and Jewish community in UK while Christianity is in middle and atheism are at the lowest. So if you going to argue that religion can be used as a tool for evil, it can also keep members accountable to do good too while atheism ethics moral despite it being positive doesn't actually results in much good action done cause of lack of accountability by the lack of believe in the higher power.

> Thats a redundant statement

You can thank the damn auto-correct for that double atrocity repeat. I meant to say “religion is the most common cause behind atrocities throughout human history”, which it is.

Its not a matter of belief, its a fact. Only up until recent centuries, humans have been religious and as such it has been the main reason behind conflicts and strife. Again this is not a belief, its written history.

“Kill them all, God will know his own.” - Spoken by a Catholic Commander overseeing the Albigensian massacre in Bezier in the year 1209. The Albigensians looked exactly the same as the Catholics and so the entire town was killed even though only half was Albigensian.

> But the left

Ah, this explains a lot. 

Listen mate, “the left” are not trying to ban pronouns that is fear-mongering dredged up by sensationalist parasites who feed off fear and who like to portray absolute fringe mentalists as an average representative of one whole group. Secondly, outright hate-speech should always be banned. No debate about that.

You always circle back to Stalin, which is so atypical of pro-religious arguments. Again, no is denying that religion is not needed for people to be bastards. Its the fact that it explicitly encourages people to be bastards and is subsequently the cause of most atrocities in human history that is being pointed out here. I dare you to come with two lists of horrible people in history; one list containing those who were not religious and one containing those who were. I guarantee you; the first list will be much, much smaller.

Religion encourages the worst of humanity and it does so by saying it has been sanctioned by an all powerful creator deity or deities, thus making people feel like any crime they commit is not a crime as its in service to their god. That is why it is so dangerous. It not only says that humans can be bastards, but that they *should* be bastards in its name.

Also as for your point on charity, that’s not really a very strong argument. Just because certain religious groups give more doesn’t suddenly mean they’re great people especially when you again take into account what they believe in.

Religion is an ideology. They’re not independent. Its a fact that religion causes evil and I only need to quote a few verses from the abrahamic bible itself to prove it;

""You shall acknowledge no God but me. . . . You are destroyed, Israel. . . . The people of Samaria must bear their guilt, because they have rebelled against their God. They will fall by the sword; their little ones will be dashed to the ground, their pregnant women ripped open."" - Hosea 13:4, 9, 16 NIV

""See, the day of the Lord is coming — a cruel day, with wrath and fierce anger. . . . I will put an end to the arrogance of the haughty. . . . Their infants will be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses will be looted and their wives violated."" - Isaiah 13:9–16 NIV

""And Jephthah made a vow to the Lord: 'If you give the Ammonites into my hands, whatever comes out of the door of my house to meet me when I return in triumph from the Ammonites will be the Lord's, and I will sacrifice it as a burnt offering.' . . . When Jephthah returned to his home in Mizpah, who should come out to meet him but his daughter, dancing to the sound of timbrels! . . . After the two months, she returned to her father, and he did to her as he had vowed."" - Judges 11:30–39 NIV

No. That's not the reason at all, and no one believes this nonsense.

- be conscripted and forced to kill or be killed.

there are countless interviews from people leaving that are like this. disgusting that people are calling them cowards from where they’re sitting in their safe comfortable house with no threat of having to choose between being drafted, dying in protest, or leaving everything and risking execution, which putin has said will happen to those who leavw. you know it’s possible to praise these brave iranian women without callously insulting other people. different scenarios exist in the world and  life is not some competition where only one group takes first place on the hero podium.

many of the people who were conscripted and are fleeing are ethnic minorities, immigrants, people there to work temporarily before returning to their home country, and men with no military training in their 50s and 60s.

Putin has literally said “if you flee we will execute you”. they too are risking their lives. i never said what they are doing is the same kind of protesting a the girls and women in iran, who are doing what their situation calls for, very powerfully i believe. but not all protest is taking to the streets and showing vocal and physical resistance. there’s not a hierarchy of methods with action in the streets on top. never heard of civil disobedience? non-violence? boycotts? refusing to fight for russia is refusing to put russia ahead of their own lives. yet commenters here act as if valuing and saving one’s own life is something shameful and worthy of mockery and calling them cowards. i notice people doing this are not calling the people staying behind going about their lives in russia like the war isn’t happening cowards. not calling the ones who were conscripted and went along with it, now in the ukraine killing ukranians and dying for putins lie cowards. just the men who left out of refusal to fight and be killed. whether to save themselves or because they disagreed with the war and didn’t see another way out.


if these were ukrainian men leaving ukraine while it is being attacked, you may have a point. but the only way to avoid mandatory conscription is to leave or be jailed/killed. **so again i ask: what exactly do you think they could/should have done?** you expect these people, many of whom are impoverished minorities who don’t speak the language, to fight for the country that treats them like it’s not theirs? they ARE fighting for their values- saving your own life is a value, and not a stupid one, as much as warmongers would have you believe life is cheap.

in case you didn’t know, there ARE protesters protesting the war and conscription- they are being beaten in the streets all over russia. once they’re arrested they’re forced onto busses and sent away to fight. how is that better than leaving?

ipjvx1a,technology,"(obligatory ""I am not a lawyer, this is not legal advice"" disclaimer, dealing with sanctions is just part of my job)

For any Americans concerned about the legality of providing proxy services to Iranians given US sanctions on Iran, the US government has a specific carveout (a general license) allowing Americans to provide services to allow ordinary Iranians (not the Iranian government) to freely use the Internet for personal communications: 

https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm0322

Proxy tools are specifically called out in one of the general licenses that provides this carveout. Standing up a proxy server should fall under the ""services necessary for the operation of such software"" carveout on page 9:

https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/iran_gld1.pdf

I can't speak with respect to anything an intelligence agency might do, however. Given that providing a proxy service to protesting Iranians is in line with US policy and interests, I doubt the Intelligence Community would care about the person providing that service (the information passing through that proxy is a different matter).

Iran SIM card. I bought this from a phone store in Tehran and didn't have to give ID. It sounds like IDs should be linked to SIMs but it isn't always enforced. I didn't have to provide details on my foreign SIMs to border officials either.

Everyone I met had a VPN app on their phone. It wasn't just limited to young people either. There were two free android apps I used.

Other comments suggested that AWS and other cloud networks are blocked in Iran. I don't think this is feasible or true. What Iran does do is deep packet inspection of data going across the border. If you send data to a standard VPN port, it's probably going to be blocked. If the connection uses a standard VPN packet headers it's probably going to be blocked. There's an article I read a couple of year ago about someone having to modify SSH packet structure so that their connection wasn't dropped (can't find it now though sadly).

I think Iran does block some stuff based on location or IP, but I think a lot of it is decided by deep packet inspection. It would also go to explaining why cross border internet traffic is so slow.",1663918710.0

Proxy *can* be set manually in the app, so they don’t *have* to click on a link. Rest still applies: the address needs to reach them somehow). If you DM the link via Twitter, cool. If the regime blocks Twitter, tough luck. If you send the link via WhatsApp, cool. If the regime blocks WhatsApp, tough luck.

Proxies like this can be weaponized against other people or governments as well. You wouldn't want attackers sending malicious data that is traceable back to your IP.

Update 1 - Looks legit at least. Cool concept, but I suspect a VPN would be better.  Maybe this is better if some tech savvy family member wanted to help out less tech savvy  family member.

Update 2 - This is a reverse proxy, powered by nginx, intended to be run in docker.  It accepts incoming traffic on port 80 and port 443 and passes it to signal's servers only.

To access the tor network in this situation you need bridges. It can be difficult to obtain them for your average user if most tor services and the tor project website are blocked.

ipkf18a,technology,"Signal is strongly end-to-end encrypted but it's not decentralized. The service uses servers and IP addresses to operate just like any other distributed web service.  The upside being that there's no way for the information that travels through those servers to be decrypted by anyone (or anything) other than the original sender and receiver. Even the data's origin/destination and all other metadata are hidden, and that's what makes Signal safe.  

If Signal were somehow decentralized, that would mean that the service would need to operate on a network of publicly-operated nodes.  It would basically be something more akin to a blockchain and every node would need a fully-up to date copy of every message and file that had ever been sent and received in the history of the service in order to maintain the integrity of the network.  End users would probably also need a copy of this ledger too. Then you'd have to have some form of mining and reward system for operating a node (or a staking system for consensus).  All unfeasible, and yet to be invented.  

So, Iran can block Signal by simply blocking access to Signal's IP addresses or DNS at the ISP level, which I assumed is government-operated. 

Interesting side note, there's been a few attempts at creating peer to peer messaging services using BitTorrent, but they never really saw wide adoption and they died quickly (Bleep etc).

This is true. But what about when it's not in transit? Once TLS is terminated at the proxy, your data is in clear text on the server itself and your request can be logged. Not just your source/destination IP, but the content of your HTTP request as well.

This is an issue with a VPN as well (**We don't log** in their advertising means **We don't do the thing jb4334 just outlined**). But the upside of a VPN is it's not some rando on the internet with no track record.

Also if they want even the slightest possibility that their proxy system has an impact, they need a ""double click and go"" solution that works on more than just linux, otherwise it's too easy to just block them too because you won't get a lot of people to run these proxies. To have even a small chance, you have to fight them in numbers.

The Tor project has a fantastic example of this they call [snowflake](https://snowflake.torproject.org/).

This is a pretty interesting article that gets at what I’m talking about. Professors are beginning to realize that their students don’t posses a functional understanding of file systems or directory structures. As in, like, many of them don’t understand the concept of a “folder” containing files.

After chia ended being profitable for me I looked at the pc and though what I could do with it, and started making it a NAS.

Another example from my experience:
- I don't like ads
- discover the pihole project, which blocks ads and runs on a raspberry pi
- i don't have a pi, so I look for an alternative
- I discover pihole can run on docker, learn docker while trying to get it working
- pihole works at network level, learn a bunch of networking stuff, dns servers, dhcp, VPN etc.

As far as the basic Internet is concerned - moving packets around - IP Addresses are not specific to or bound to any country.

What they do is fib to the Geolocation database providers. IP Address Geolocation is something web sites try to think is reality. But if you have a block of addresses and decide to use them in Warsaw instead of Quebec, you don't have to ask anyone and you don't have to tell anyone. Your router will make the necessary announcements on how to get to the address block, but that doesn't include WHERE it is, just what networks it is connected to. 

So, if you use one of these ""Virtual IP Address"" VPN servers, be it for Moscow, or Hanoi, or Bangalore (Bengaluru), when you connect to a web site the web site will ask a Geolocation provider where the IP Address is located, and it will say Moscow or whatever.

Well, yes, ostensibly it is the government's purpose to settle civil conflict, but in terms of a cost-benefit analysis, the government seems to prefer to invest its time and resources into things that have more of a tangible impact on lived human experience other than copyright law and digital property rights, which is the main reason it's not very interested in bringing pirates up on criminal charges. They leave that to civil court system while they go after violent criminals and tax evaders (drug traffickers fall under both of these lmao).

I think the idea that VPNs make digital crimes such as CP and the dark economy much more difficult to catch and prosecute is also a little ill-informed. You often see this being the case in criminal investigations; the digital security is one of the harder parts to crack, but they don't need to crack the digital security to catch these guys. For example, CP is often busted when local watchers are caught and they co-operate for better outcomes. They give all the information they can, which implicates those they received it from, which is how they track down those producing it.

As always, physical penetration is often the most successful method of breaking into someone's security. This guy might have a password-protected hard drive, but the password is taped to his monitor, or it's in his password manager on Firefox which ISN'T password-protected. The same goes for the dark economy/money laundering, the digital enterprise is just a tool, the real action, as it always has, takes places in the real world, and people are even more lazy with their IRL habits than they are with their digital habits, because living IRL gives people a false sense of security. People don't even notice CCTV cameras anymore.

I think the importance of VPNs to criminal activities is overstated, and the powers that be might prefer to keep it that way, because it leads the criminals to believe that their digital security is keeping them safe, when the real weak-points in their operation are, and always have been, physical and human.",1663946390.0

ipy2pmy,soccer,"Both the quran and hadith are very ""governance"" oriented, the reason why Islam always becomes so political is because it's scriptures encourage it. The quran specifically goes into how society should be run.

Surah nisa (the women) states that men are the caretakers/maintainers of women (which is a sanitised translation, it's more like they are dominant). It sets out a path the man should follow should his wife be ""disobedient"", ending with of course beating. Now, a lot of quran translations will sanitise this too, saying it's with a toothbrush or a light tap etc. But the original quran translates as ""beat them"", nothing more, nothing less.

>Plus these people they like to twist and turns the words of God and even change the whole meaning to something.

It's more the other way, they twist the meanings to make them more appealing than they actually are. Like the previous example of beating women conveniently being modernised to ""it's just a ritualistic tap bro the quran doesn't say you can beat your wife"".

And then we go on to the origin of the hijab,. The hijab was imposed on women because Muhammad's horny friend Umar couldn't control himself after seeing one of Muhammad's many wives take a shit (seriously). Note how pushy he was about covering women, and no choice was placed on the women. If Muhammad's wives were forced to cover up, why would people just randomly assume it's a choice now? The situation is very similar to what is going on in Iran of women minding their business and men forcing them to cover up.

>Narrated 'Aisha: The wives of the Prophet used to go to Al-Manasi, a vast open place (near Baqia at Medina) to answer the call of nature at night. 'Umar used to say to the Prophet ""Let your wives be veiled,"" but Allah's Apostle did not do so. One night Sauda bint Zam'a the wife of the Prophet went out at 'Isha' time and she was a tall lady. 'Umar addressed her and said, ""I have recognized you, O Sauda."" He said so, as he desired eagerly that the verses of Al-Hijab (the observing of veils by the Muslim women) may be revealed. So Allah revealed the verses of ""Al-Hijab"" (A complete body cover excluding the eyes).

Sahih hadith, Sahih Bukhari 1:4:148

RE: ""there is no compulsion in religion"". This phrase has seemingly been twisted, it's never meant that you are free to do as you please, but rather that god would never force you to do something you're not capable of doing. That is why that single phrase goes against pretty much every other verse or hadith on the same topic. There are many tafsir and fiqh that go into the quran verses and what they mean and contextualise them. Islam was studied for centuries upon centuries, most islamic scholars have it right. It's just that the ""right"" is hard to swallow because it shows Islam as an oppressive and dangerous ideology (like most religions). That's why most of the new age reinterpretation is happening now in the face of progressive culture.",1664179186.0

Why are you hyperfocused on how Iran compares to other neighbouring countries? Iran should strive to better itself as a country, even if it was surrounded by the 4 worst nations around.

>They hold presidential and parliamentary elections (unlike most of the neighbouring countries).

And these ""elections"" are a sham. The religious overlords have already decided who the next people in power will be.

>Women in Iran are among the most educated in the region

And you know why that is? The foundation of wanting to move women from stay-at-home mothers to women following education was placed by the previous goverment. Reza Shah Pahlavi created many of the most prestigious universities in the country, such as University of Tehran and Shiraz University. That was one of his goals, to educate women more and more.

>I am not saying there are no major problems there, but I just don't understand why they get more hatred than their neighbors.

Again, why does it matter what their neighbours are doing? Fact is, Iran has had the everliving shit sanctioned out of them, because the religious people in power are using their anti-USA stance to wage war and destruction in other countries (most notably Syria), and to stay in power under a farce of a cause that most of the population doesn't even believe in.

There are many homeless and begging children and women in Iran, because of the financial ruin that the country is in. And I don't mean that Iran isn't rich, far from it; it is one of the most resource-rich countries out there, above all oil.

To give an example (though this makes more sense for EU people as USA wages are different), if you were earning minimum wage at €1500, you would pay €50 for a carton of milk and some bananas. A bag of rice would cost you €125. And imagine on top of these insane prices, you have rent, child and other costs. Even existing families have to resort to giving their children bread with tomato sauce, not having enough to feed themselves. If once a month they get some meat, it's maybe even filled with coloured cotton inside (which yes, believe it or not that has happened).

Because of how the resourcefully rich Iran has been managed, all but the religious elite are suffering. The government has SOLD parts of the country (iirc 20%) to China, with them interested in fishing and mining spots. Is this something that a non-criminal government would do?",1664185810.0

The 77-cents-on-the-dollar statistic is calculated by dividing the median earnings of all women

average income of all men is, say, 40,000 dollars a year, and the average annual income of
all women is, say, 30,800 dollars, that would mean that women earn 77 cents for every dollar
a man earns. 30,800 divided by 40,000 equals .77.

But these calculations don’t reveal a gender wage injustice because it doesn’t take into
account occupation, position, education or hours worked per week.

Even a study by the American Association of University Women, a feminist organization, shows
that the actual wage gap shrinks to only 6.6 cents when you factor in different choices men
and women make. And the key word here is “choice.” The small wage gap that does exist has

The big one most point to is that women find it harder to advance in careers due to childbearing - a twofold of not being promoted due to concerns over taking 3-9 months off for delivery and immediate postnatal period, and the fact socially we expect women to take even more time off usually with maternity leave rather than split it 50/50 with paternity leave. Can be helped by encouraging the latter, and for the former encouraging more part time sharing of leadership roles so time off for delivering kids is less of a barrier to promotion.

But I do think you're arguing against a strawman of your own creation. I consider myself a western feminist and am certainly happy to criticize Iran's policies, especially on this topic. As is the Biden administration and many prominent feminists. 

My understanding of intersectionalism is that many of the issues sociology looks at can't be properly understood through just one ""ism"" lens (eg calling the wage gap JUST a feminist issue is flawed). They intersect across race, gender, and class lines. Its a movement about recognizing that intersection.

I would suggest you don’t allow your anecdotal experience to draw these conclusions. This is such a ridiculously intentional attempt to misconstrue feminism as a means to attack feminism itself. No where in intersectional feminism does it state that that is an “ideology” of what it is. It is precisely not intersectional feminism to try to hijack someone else’s experience and claim that someone’s “is worse”. 

Intersectional feminism is simply about how different social/cultural/economic systems operate together to define experiences. 

You can read about it here: https://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2020/6/explainer-intersectional-feminism-what-it-means-and-why-it-matters

> impossible for someone who doesn’t belong to a certain demographic to understand the dynamics of said demographic 

Lmao so are you saying you can inherently understand the experiences of someone from a different race, ethnicity, religion, gender, and socioeconomic upbringing etc.? I wish that were true but it simply is not.

You also don’t answer my question. How does intersectional feminism ignore non western women? Why do you think feminists are afraid of speaking out against discrimination and prejudices that occur in non western countries? Intersectional feminism just means you shouldn’t try to speak for those women and you need to allow space for those women to share their experiences and opinions. That is what intersectional feminism is about not whatever drivel you are spouting.

Inequality is not an option. In choice you have options, yes.

Is someone forcing women to have babies or is it their choice? Are you really saying women are forced to have babies or else humanity will die out? Who is forcing them? 

As I understand it, no one. That is a fact and can be observed by the decline in natality rates. 

>Having kids is a choice until you realise the human race would die out if we decided not to. 

Did you already realise and that's why you have kids now? Or that's why you will have kids? Or is it going to be your choice?

Therefore the question is, ""is it acceptable that women alone accept the career consequences for the continuation of the human species"". I would say the answer should clearly be no.

No question. Just writing to say stay safe 🙏 ❤️|Thank you friend, you too. I wish Iran gets the freedom it deserves so people can see how beautiful it can be.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/xz5j32/im_an_iranian_living_in_iran_ama_about_iran/irkp8pk/)
Hello from the USA! I hope that freedom will prevail in Iran, it is insane what has been happening over there and the whole world has your back! A few questions:  1) Are the protests starting to get stronger and stronger or weaker and weaker?  2) Not so much of a question as a statement: This seems to be more of a revolution now, the people need to start taking out the police and IRGC somehow....I love videos of them getting their asses kicked|Hello and thank you for the kind words! It really means a lot to know people are cheering for us all over the world. To answer your questions:  1. The protests are moving forward slowly but steadily; they are aggressive for a few days, then they go quiet with small protests taking place here and there, and then people return to streets with full force again (usually on Saturdays, which is the first day of the week for us). Today everything peaked and lots of videos came out showing the government's forces running from the people and being beaten by them.  2. Thanks for pointing that out, and yes, it IS a revolution! People have reportedly taken control over some cities (Bukan, Oshnavieh, etc), and Zahedan and Sanandaj literally look like battlefields. This time, we won't stop until we free ourselves from the evil IR.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/xz5j32/im_an_iranian_living_in_iran_ama_about_iran/irkk8hl/)
Do most Iranians like the USA Or hate the USA or not care at all|They either don't care or they like the USA. We don't have a reason to be enemies with the Americans, but the IR tries to demonstrate to the world that all Iranians hate USA with their stupid anti-USA and anti-Semitic propaganda, but that's not who we are.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/xz5j32/im_an_iranian_living_in_iran_ama_about_iran/irkmxic/)
The situation of women in Iran is mind bogging to us women in the west. I have my own car and home, get up and go to work wearing  pants or skirt, sweater, uncovered head. The idea of being murdered for such a basic freedom is incomprehensible. Do you think your protests are going to change anything? Wishing you well  from Canada, stay strong!|Hello and thank you for your kind words! Fun fact since you're from Canada and people may not know this:  Sepah (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps) scumbags have deep roots in Canada. They either live there, or have sent their offspring/family members to live there while the people are suffering here. Justin Trudeau has been under a lot of pressure about this, and finally he announced Sepah a terrorist organization and banned them.  And to answer your question, yes, absolutely! We've had many protests here over the years, but this time it has been different. Everyone, no matter their age, ideology or religion have come to the streets. I even saw a picture of several Chadori women protesting alongside the people, not to mention the incredible support from everyone around the world.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/xz5j32/im_an_iranian_living_in_iran_ama_about_iran/irl1f3l/)
Does Mahsa Amini being Kurdish have any kind of undertone in anything that's happened or not at all?|Not at all. The Morality Police officers who murdered her didn't know she was Kurdish. And that's the point: Mahsa Amini could have been any one of us. What happened to her happens to Iranian women everyday, with some variations (not all of them are as brutal).  That said, the protests began in Saghez (Mahsa's hometown) and the Kurdish people have been in the front line since day 1.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/xz5j32/im_an_iranian_living_in_iran_ama_about_iran/irkf074/)
Is this a coup or is it just protesting? What are the chances we will see a regime change?  Love from Australia, hope you folks get the freedoms you deserve|Thank you kind stranger. I sincerely hope so too.  I can't exactly call it a coup, since the regime is still in charge and fighting till the last ounce of power. But if the protests and strikes go on like this it's bound to happen soon!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/xz5j32/im_an_iranian_living_in_iran_ama_about_iran/irkzemf/)
My heart goes out to you and your beautiful country! Stay safe. I'm praying for you.|Thank you kind stranger.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/xz5j32/im_an_iranian_living_in_iran_ama_about_iran/irkrsnp/)
We are all hoping you will win. The world is watching the videos which are trickling out.  What do you think will happen next? How widespread is the ferling of rebellion, like all ages, city and village? Are many men supporting?|Hello, and thank you for the support. You guys have been amazing.  I believe if it goes on like this just a little bit longer we'll win. The protests are happening in main cities such as Tehran, Isfahan, Shiraz, Zahedan, Rasht, and so on, and the people are quite diverse. You can see people from all ages (but mostly teenagers and students), and men are fighting alongside us for freedom. The unity is beautiful to watch.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/xz5j32/im_an_iranian_living_in_iran_ama_about_iran/irl5tg7/)
I am so in awe of you Iranians making a stand!  How are protesters really being received?|Thank you! The government is doing everything in its power to stop us, but the people have made up their mind and they're not gonna stop anytime soon.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/xz5j32/im_an_iranian_living_in_iran_ama_about_iran/irkttsc/)
How can I help the movement from Canada? I don’t use social media other than Reddit so I can’t really share.|It means a lot that you're willing to help, so thank you. You can sign petitions and look out for any kind of disinformation and point it out if possible.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/xz5j32/im_an_iranian_living_in_iran_ama_about_iran/irl2mfw/)
No question,  I just want to say I hope yall stay safe. And I'm rooting for you guys and gals, and I'm ao proud of what you're doing. Much love|Thank you for the support. It means a lot and I hope we can reconnect to the world after these murderers are gone.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/xz5j32/im_an_iranian_living_in_iran_ama_about_iran/irl426j/)
What's your favorite historic place to visit in Iran? I'm hoping to visit someday after you all are successful! What would be something to see that isn't necessarily super well known?|I hope you can visit soon! If you're into historic places you can find many of them in Shiraz, Isfahan, and Yazd. My favourites are the Alamut Castle and Hormoz Portuguese Castle.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/xz5j32/im_an_iranian_living_in_iran_ama_about_iran/irl8ph7/)
What do you think it’ll take to make sure another oppressive regime to take over Iranian government ? (Just so it’s not another outcome that happened after the former revolution in the 70’s) do you believe foreign aid might be required to make sure another oppressive government doesn’t seize power in case this one ends up toppling ?  Sending my love to the people of Iran. I pray for your safety, freedom and life  Edit : I also wanted to ask what can non Iranians do to be supportive ?|Hello, and thank you for the kind words. It's great that you want to help, and you can do so by signing petitions and stopping disinformation from spreading whenever you see it.  The people are way more intelligent and woke compared to the 70's, so I believe they will make the right choice. Right now, the revolution has no leader. This shows the amazing unity between Iranians, and in my opinion they do need the support but not the direct interfervention of any foreign government (which usually backfires and the country becomes their possession).  They just need a solid constitution and coalition consisting of reliable and intellectual people until they can choose a new government.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/xz5j32/im_an_iranian_living_in_iran_ama_about_iran/irlb8pg/)
Freedom loving people everywhere are with you in heart and spirit. Is there anything we ordinary people can do to help from the USA?|Thank you for your support, kind stranger. You can sign petitions and stop disinformation from spreading. You can also put in a good word for us with your friends :) I know many people in the USA have the wrong image about us due to the IR's sick propaganda, but we are nothing like that image.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/xz5j32/im_an_iranian_living_in_iran_ama_about_iran/irlarcl/)
Stay safe, and keep fighting the good fight. Free people the world over are wishing for your success and freedom!|Thank you for the support. It means a lot ❤️|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/xz5j32/im_an_iranian_living_in_iran_ama_about_iran/irldqfy/)
Where are protests usually situated and how does everyone coordinate where to go?|Iranians are very active on Twitter and Instagram (although both are filtered right now) and that's where they coordinate.  The protests usually take place in main squares and streets that are strategically safer so they can run from the oppressive forces in case they get trapped.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/xz5j32/im_an_iranian_living_in_iran_ama_about_iran/irlaolt/)

iro4hny,AMA,"Hi, I was in Zahedan last Friday when the Baluchis and Security forces clashed and I am now in Kerman. Somehow the protests in both these places appeared mild compared to all the other areas. In the morning up to 1pm everyone behaves as usual and surprisingly, women are still in hijab although there are no morality police around. I've not seen them since the protests started. Between 1-6pm most shops are closed and the cities are quiet. After 6pm the protest start. In both cities I lived/lve like two blocks away from where they held/hold the protests and although I can hear fireworks and sometimes what sounds like gunshots ( in Zahedan it was definitely gunshots), I don't see the type of violence as in the other cities so far.

irlw263,AMA,"Hello! Interesting questions; 

1. There are two types of religious people in Iran, one group consists of people who believe in Islam but don't want anything to do with the corrupt government. The innocent people of Zahedan who were [massacred](https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/iran-least-82-protesters-and-bystanders-killed-bloody-crackdown-baluchistan) during the last week were an example of this. 
The other group consists of religious extremists who are helping the government and doing their dirty work for them by oppressing protestors and assaulting men and women in the streets. 

2. The Iranian government forces everyone to wear the hijab, regardless of their beliefs. 

3. I am very hopeful. This time, the protests have been very consistent and the people have shown an outstanding amount of bravery, so yes, I believe we will succeed. 

4. I want everyone to know how they are committing massacres all over Iran. You probably know this, but I want to emphasize on how brave the people are. They are fighting these brutes with their bare hands, and they ARE succeeding. 

I also want everyone to know that many of these bastards (members of the IRGC) have dual citizenship or permanent residency in foreign countries, especially Canada. They are taking the place of talented individuals, and they have to be banned and dealt with after all this is over.",1665299062.0

irlrat1,AMA,"Hello and thanks for the interesting questions and kind words. To answer your questions:

1. All of the issues you mentioned are contentious, but the main thing that made people rise up is the violence against women and the oppression they've been enduring for 40+ years. 

2. The government has done nothing to address it, except call us ""agitators"" and ""troublemakers"", and try to oppress us more. 

3. I believe it's too soon to say which issues they have been successful or failing in. However, we managed to make our voices heard and tell our stories to the whole world. They can no longer oppress women the way they used to, and this is an amazing achievement in my opinion. 

4. Honestly, there's sooo much to talk about. The freedom of expression, the choice to wear clothes you want (at school, work, etc), the ability to live a normal life as an LGBTQ member - or a woman, I could go on. 

But the most important issue is how we, as women, can't feel safe walking in the streets of Iran. Not just because of murderers and rapists, but because the morality police can arrest us anytime they want, no matter what we're wearing. And if that doesn't happen, Basiji's and extremist passerby can assault us, telling us to put on our hijab.",1665295487.0

This shows the amazing unity between Iranians, and in my opinion they do need the support but not the direct interfervention of any foreign government (which usually backfires and the country becomes their possession).

Those guys hate America / probably dislike Americans and see them as decadent colonizers / degenerates. These are very conservative folks who get all their info on there and don't care that much, if you'd push me I'd say they are something between 10-25% of the population, either ruling upper class or rural traditional folks. Then you got unpolitical folks that are not that interested in politics but are also critical with the regime, maybe 20-35%, they don't care but I'd say they are either neutral or pretty positive towards America and Americans, often seeing them as the enemy of the regime that is keeping them poor.


The rest, which I'd estimate to around 40%, mostly younger / urban people who hate the regime and are pretty western oriented, will love America, it's hard to explain but there's a fascination with it that you see in similar countries that people there have for it, if they find out you're American they'd probably think thats pretty cool and immediately try to convince you that they don't like their government and how they are ashamed of it. Most Iranians outside of Iran are like this too, of course once you leave the fascination wears off, but the positive attitude remains. So overall I'd say young people and progressives which are sort of the majority really like America. Then there are many who are neutral and a portion of the population who is exactly like the regime wants it to be, how cliches portray it",1665277977.0

Iran has already shown it has no problems with doing uplink jamming; it already does that with satellite tv, which is in direct contravention to ITU rules, and also isn't even that much of a threat compared to internet.

For those who don't know, uplink jamming (also called orbital jamming) is basically flooding satellites with high-power noise from ground stations, effectively disabling them over your territory (and everyone else's territory the satellite happens to be passing over). This is illegal, the UN has condemned it, and in some cases can even be an act of war. But Iran **does not care**.

They've invested a ton of money and resources into sophisticated high-power uplink jamming systems.

Videos don't depend on latency. They depend on throughput. Throughput is somewhat lowered by bad latency due to the error-correcting nature of protocols incurring more overhead, but it isn't the only knob to twist.  

Music -- see above, but only moreso.  

Games _are_ affected by latency, with real-time games (e.g. FPS'es) being most affected. However, not all games are -- single-player games and _many_ strategy games do not care about latency.

If you open [google.com](https://google.com). First of all your client asks your local dns server  to get the ip (+200ms). You process the ip and start requesting the website (+200ms).

Actually Iran is not an MRA issue, nor it is, in essence, ""FRA"" issue.

1)  Iran became a totalitarian religious dictatorship in the second half of XX century.

In 60th there were short skirts and make up.
Than Islamic revolution came, and fucked everything over.

Not everybody was happy with their country suddenly returning to XVI century, and also becoming an international pariah because of their nuclear program and hostile attitude towards Sunni and West.

They tried to protest in 2019, If I recall, but were put down by police aka ""Guardians of Islamic Revolution"".

2)  Islamic culture, though, kinda opressive (from our POV) to women (in some cases very opressive), also promotes men to be protective of them.

Therefore

3)  We have a seminal case of a young women died after being beaten by police for not adhering to their fucked-up rules about how women should look.

*A young beautifull woman.*

And this was a final straw. And a first spark.
Now they basically have a *casus belli* to rise up against their fucked-up government, wich they do now.
They are fed up.

 Not only with women opression, but with  kinda all this bullshit regime.

So, though, it was started as a women rights issue, technically, in reality it is a huge inevitable (judging by how Iranian government treated their people as shit) political process, that far exceeds both FRA and MRA perspective.

Women of my country were oppressed by the this regime for 43 years and you expect us to leave our sisters and mothers to fight the most brutal security forces by themselves and not step up for them? Is this your definition of men's rights? Of course I'm going to stand up for the women of my country. These aren't your obnoxious western feminists campaigning about air conditioning in workplace, these women are truly oppressed and they're fighting for their most basic human rights. It's my responsibility to stand up for the oppressed as a man. I'm fucking proud of the Iranian man who are standing up for their women like this. And so are Iranian women. My social media feed is full of posts from Iranian women who are grateful and proud that the men are standing by them. Of course this women hating sub doesn't see those.

iq0b7q4,MensRights,">that they have to have special protections and laws and funding that don't apply to men. If that's not true then demanding special treatment is sexist, isn't it?

Where are you getting that information? Can you please cite some sources? I ask this because for example, second-wave feminism tried to pass the [Equal Rights Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Rights_Amendment) which was meant to set up women as equal to men in society, and the reason that it didn't pass was that the conservative movement(anti-feminists) under the helm of [Phyllis Schlafly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllis_Schlafly) argue that those special protections were going to be lost and brought the amendment down. So I don't quite think feminists or at the very least a sizable portion of feminists (all second wave) would agree with that point you are making.

There is also another issue that the feminists are not ONE group, there are multiple factions and they even disagree between them, a clear example is [porn](https://msmagazine.com/2014/06/10/feminist-debates-1-pornography.), there isn't a clear agreement on multiculturalism inside of the movement or reproductive rights, and as you can see from the second wave movement it wasn't the feminist who argue in favor of special protections.

So I'm very curious as to why you think that feminists want to discriminate against you or why you think the whole movement revolves around ""special protections""?

>No- you are. Pointing out your bigotry isn't itself bigotry. Even if I did ""hate"" people like you (eg demanding laws against you) which I am not, then you're a political group not a birth group.

In order to do that you attack the points I'm making and not me for making them and there lies my critic. For example, in order to challenge my point you could have pointed out in which ways were the men not the perpetrators of the discrimination of women in Iran, explaining how they were not the ones who had the power in Iran or explaining how the constitution of Iran sets them as equals and go from there.. but no, you see how much if a discussion and exchange of ideas we could have had, yet you think you are not a bigot because you already know the ""truth"" about ""feminists"" and I'm the bigot for actually listening and agreeing with points that they make :/",1664219755.0

I said that AFTER you asked for a source so it's hard to see how that was what you were referring to isn't it?  But since you ask about a completely different thing:

* NOW created a new amendment called the ""constitutional equality amendment"" (or CEA) which was explicit in saying their new version of the ERA would not take any rights from women but would give them more new rights.  It's now very hard to find on their web site but you can try googling it.

* then there's the Hayden rider: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Rights_Amendment#Hayden_rider_and_protective_labor_legislation

* and don't you think it's odd that Feminists get everything they ask for except this one thing?

The truth is the (originally worded) ERA would demolish most of the gains the movement has made in the last century.  It would be a disaster for feminism.  Everything they work for is sexist and would be destroyed by the ERA and yet they pretend (with the above exceptions) to support it? and weirdly it never gets passed?

Btw did you know when they were talking about the ERA in Congress they talked to only women's groups and ignored all the men's groups who asked to talk about the issues?

So they didn't ban them against men who are a large number of the victims?  Not that you'd give a shit of course.  Acid throwing used to be and remains in some places mostly a women's weapon.

your initial argument was ""the feminists"" want special protections, and then you proceded to cite the answer to the conservative movement in 1950s against the ERA using in part the hayden rider modification, and we can extract some quotes: 

>supporters of the original ERA believed it negated the amendment's original purpose—causing the amendment not to be passed in the House

>Eleanor Roosevelt and most New Dealers also opposed the ERA. They felt that ERA was designed for middle-class women, but that working-class women needed government protection.

you also skipped the section before hayden:

>Since the 1920s, the Equal Rights Amendment has been accompanied by discussion among feminists about the meaning of women's equality.[22] Alice Paul and her National Woman's Party asserted that women should be on equal terms with men in all regards, **even if that means sacrificing benefits given to women through protective legislation, such as shorter work hours and no night work or heavy lifting**
 
""the feminists"" are not a single monster and they are multiple people who have different points of view and different agendas as we can read, no, not all of them agreed with special protections, and with that your whole argument becomes nothing. 

It's common to hear people playing into tribalism and identity politics. The truth is never as simple, ""the feminists"" are not a monster, I do agree that there are people who identify as feminists that are extremists and very difficult to deal with, but looking at this conversation I fail to see how they are different from you. 

Now on to women education on Iran: 

>Actually a lot more women graduate university than men in Iran. You didn't know?

> So basically, you don't know anything about gender issues in Iran and are just guessing and putting out bullshit?

Oh yeah I did, you also skipped how they applied quotas because too many women were getting educated: 

https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3974198,00.html
https://www.reuters.com/article/cnews-us-iran-women-idCABRE88L03L20120922

I'm off this thread, but I wanted to clarify these points because people might get the wrong idea. It's important not to take the facts at face value but to understand the complex systems in which we live.

ipzextu,MensRights,"You’re not even smart enough to make a valid argument. You deflect to a different subject. “Uh, we’ll, men die in wars.” You also stole my line, you couldn’t even come up with your own. 

Men and women can both be oppressed. We’re discussing a situation when women were being oppressed by men. In your example, guess who’s oppressing men. Other men. Women aren’t forcing men to be soldiers, it’s the government…which is ran by men! Fuck man.

iq480ck,MensRights,"> ""the feminists"" are not a single monster

Prove it.  Sorry but that shit just bores me.  You feminists coming in and making idiotic propaganda statements as if it means anything.  All stated as if nobody could possibly disagree.  Feminists are all the same.

The fact is feminists have never done anything for equality.  Sure they lie and pretend and lie some more as your ""sources"" (feminist sources) say.  But in 150-200 years when have they ever done anything that was for equality?  You point to the ERA and I point out that (1) it never passed (2) it wasn't about equality and you're pretending it ought to count anyway?

With that logic you could prove Nazis were anti-racist.  It's easy just swap ""Nazis"" for ""feminists"" in your argument.  Otherwise the same exact argument runs word for word.

> [Nazis] are not a single monster and they are multiple people who have different points of view and different agendas as we can read, no, not all of them agreed with [murdering Jews], and with that your whole argument becomes nothing.

Yeah I don't think you proved Nazis are good guys with that.  

> It's common to hear people playing into tribalism and identity politics. The truth is never as simple, ""the Nazis"" are not a monster, I do agree that there are people who identify as Nazis that are extremists and very difficult to deal with, but looking at this conversation I fail to see how they are different from you.

iqgw84l,worldnews,"> they can probably just relax the hijab rules to appease the protestors once they stop being stubborn.

Nah, there's little chance this happens. If you say that, you're not really understanding how the Ayatollah function. Khamenei and his ilk are not your run-of-the-mill Republican grifters that use religion for cash. They're not ""stubborn"" - they're *psychotic, fanatical monsters.*

[Here](https://iranwire.com/en/iran/107848-iranwire-exclusive-khamenei-may-order-a-massacre/) is the latest on Khamenei's reaction according to people close to him.

> The source said he had heard from an IRGC official that “Mr. Khamenei has decreed that they should have no mercy. Mr. Khamenei said that it makes no sense for women to burn hijab in the street. This is *moharebeh* [war against God]”.

These deranged psychopaths would rather slaughter their own population, than give even an inch - and this suspicion is all but confirmed historically speaking, given that that's pretty much exactly how they dealt with previous protests. Khamenei would never do what you suggest, and I don't really see a reason to believe any successor groomed by him would either.

The only way you deal with people like this is with violence - by cutting off their heads - or, more generally, by swaying enough sympathetic, non-fanatical military to get rid of them.

With all that said, I don't disagree with you that there's little reason to be optimistic about these protests; but what I'd recommend is violent revolution, not some push for gentle reforms that will never, ever pass as long as the Ayatollah are in power.",1664519150.0

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Mosaddegh

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalization_of_the_Iranian_oil_industry

> On March 15, 1951, legislation to nationalize the oil industry was passed by the Majlis with a majority of votes. On March 17 the Majlis verified the nationalization of Iran oil industry and the AIOC was nationalized.[1][5]

> In the aftermath of March 1951, the economic crisis worsened and Iranian oil was not bought by other countries. The Abadan Refinery, at the time one of the largest oil refineries in the world, was closed. The nationalization of the Iranian oil industry continued even through strong opposition from the United States and the United Kingdom.

>In the first year of the nationalization, the only foreign sale of Iranian oil were 300 barrels to an Italian merchant ship. Foreign oil companies prevented any impacts of the Iranian withdrawal from being felt by consumer countries by increasing output elsewhere. Oil production was expanded by BP and ARAMCO in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq. Oil production in the Middle East increased by around 10% annually in 1951, 1952 and 1953. With Iranian oil production decreasing from 242 million barrels in 1950 to 10.6 million barrels in 1952, the loss of oil exports severely impacted the economy.[10]

>In August 1953, the government of Mosaddegh was overthrown by a military coup d'état orchestrated by the United States Central Intelligence Agency and the British Secret Intelligence Service. Mosaddegh was sentenced to three years in prison and then kept under house arrest until his death in 1967.[11][12]

>After the coup, the Iranian oil crisis ended and the AIOC did not succeed to stop production. The National Iranian oil company as an international consortium was founded and the AIOC was made a member. With the nationalization of the oil industry, British and American political influence continued for years after coup.[1]

> Zahedi's new government soon reached an agreement with foreign oil companies to form a consortium and ""restore the flow of Iranian oil to world markets in substantial quantities"", giving the United States and Great Britain the lion's share of the restored British holdings. In return, the US massively funded the Shah's resulting government, until the Shah's overthrow in 1979.[72]

>As soon as the coup succeeded, many of Mosaddegh's former associates and supporters were tried, imprisoned, and tortured. Some were sentenced to death and executed.[73] The minister of foreign affairs and the closest associate of Mosaddegh, Hossein Fatemi, was executed by order of the Shah's military court. The order was carried out by firing squad on 10 November 1954.[74]",1664535923.0

Totally different (and more effective) level of psycho.

The Shah had an image of himself as the ""father of his people,"" and while a father may discipline harshly, there is a limit.

 >The nationalization of the Iranian oil industry resulted from a movement in the Iranian parliament (Majlis) to seize control of Iran's oil industry, which had been run by private companies, largely controlled by foreign interests. The legislation was passed on March 15, 1951, and was verified by the Majlis on March 17, 1951. The legislation led to the nationalization of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (AIOC). The movement was led by Mohammad Mosaddegh, a member of the Majlis for the National Front and future prime minister of Iran.

The marches were organized by nonviolent activists to demonstrate the desire of African-American citizens to exercise their constitutional right to vote, in defiance of segregationist repression; they were part of a broader voting rights movement underway in Selma and throughout the American South. By highlighting racial injustice, they contributed to passage that year of the Voting Rights Act, a landmark federal achievement of the civil rights movement.

Even if they did, they wouldn’t be allowed to get the surgery.

Pretty sure last time I check it out, there were some lines about Mohammed and his generals raping captured noblewomen, too. The Old Testament has its own fair share where the slaughter of Canaanite children is labeled as 'righteous and ordained by God', as the sins of their parents made them deserving of being slaughtered en masse just the same as no human being is considered to be truly devoid of sin after being born. That is why Christianity, too, regularly spawns sects that consider this and decide that every human being on earth deserves to die. It's why doomsday cults are so prevalent, with the [Heaven's Gate mass suicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven%27s_Gate_(religious_group)#Mass_suicide) being the most notorious but far from the only one.

Any religion can be used to justify the most depraved acts of violence, rape and murder there are.

The possibility of them suddenly reestablishing ties with the US is as likely as China suddenly renouncing its claims to Taiwan. Even if it is adventageous of them to do so, the govvernment is too blinded with their hatred of the west and Israel to even bother.

The only way I could even see this remotely happening is if some kind of Gorbachev kind of figure decided to stop the entire “America and Israel=Satan” schtick, or the govvernment being overthrown by a democratic one, and in my honest opinion, the latter seems to be more likely.",1665484688.0
