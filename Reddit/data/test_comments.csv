irse7mk,nextfuckinglevel,"Being a military leader is very different from being a civil leader, only some of good military leaders can be civil leaders, for example you may think that: I hate Biden but as a civil leader you must have diplomatic skills so you may say: I love Biden and think ""I can gain from saying that for my country, that is the business""

Saying things like: ""Don't celebrate before everything is over"" Or ""never ever underestimate your enemy"" would work as a military leader

The thing is all of Iranian regimes solutions are military solutions they never did a single diplomatic approach to solve the protests not a single compromise even all the tactics that aren't violent are depiction based",1665424678.0
