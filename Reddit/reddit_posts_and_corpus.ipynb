It was my dad driving, mom in the passenger with me and my grandma in the back. One of these bastard male basij militia started chasing our car with his ak47 pulling my mom out and putting her in a van to take to the station because apparently she was wearing lipstick. I just remember being terrified and crying. Eventually they let her go because by the time my dad pulled over she had wiped her make up off.\n",

One of these ladies with \"chador-veil\" came towards me and grabbed my hand, she dragged me to take me to the van. My other friends escaped from them, and it was only me that was stuck. I was so stressed, I kept crying to the lady to let me go. But she wont let go of my arm. There were also soldiers accompanying the morality police as well. I was so worried because my parents thought I was at my friends and I basically lied to them to go the mall and I was so scared that where they would take me or they would do to me☹️ I was lucky that I was able to pinch the lady's hand with my nails and free myself. She kept shouting \" come back\" at me while I was running away. I was able to hide myself in a store, in their fitting room and waited there till the police van was full and I could go out! PS: I was wearing my hijab and they didnt like that I had red lipstick on, with my bangs showing out my scarf (Of course I was 14 and I wanted to do make up and be a teenage) but it was definitely one of my worst memories that I have living in Iran dealing with morality police\n",

Human autopilot is STRONG. Many (relative to zero, but a very small % of all) convicts have put themselves *back* in prison because they can't adapt to a world that's now 15 or 20 years later. Imagine going to prison with cassette tapes and rotary phones and now the very *idea* someone doesn't have a social media account is anathema.

That part isn't even a part that I pointed out, nor is it relevant to the particular discussion. An Infidel, or Kafir, is an unbeliever. It's literal translation is faithless. It originated in the medieval century from Christians who viewed all non-christians as infidels, and then got passed on via Mecca to Muhammad's vocabulary. In addition, Hell is *not* the blessed love of the creator, nor is it a pleasant place to reside. Most often it is described as 'fire' (Al-nar) as in the following verses:\"...fear the Fire whose fuel is men and stones,- which is prepared for those who reject Faith\" (2:24).\"...Enough is Hell for a burning fire. Those who reject Our Signs, We shall soon cast into the Fire... For Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise\" (4:55-56).\"But he whose balance (of good deeds) is found to be light, will have his home in a (bottomless) Pit. And what will explain to you what this is? A Fire blazing fiercely!\" (101:8-11).\"In front of such a one is Hell, and he is given, for drink, boiling fetid water\" (14:16).\n",

And that HEAVILY negativity reflects your mental health and of course is just a violation of human rights. Wearing a scarf because you like it is fine, plenty of African cultures (not ones that practice Islam) have a whole culture around scarf wearing but the difference is they do it because of culture and freedom of expression, people who wear hijabs are doing because their religion is telling them that should because if they don’t their will be consequences. And I’m not for banning hijabs but it’s this disconnect that causes people robot understand the main problem here. The ideology is the problem, we need to stop dressing up and excusing religion for all its crimes against humanity. It’s body count exceeded the amount of people currently living on the planet right now, idk how many more people have to suffer and die for people to realize that the ideology is the problem.

Iran only just started forcing women to their ultrasounds before an abortion when we've been doing that in America for decades. Not to mention, both Islam and Judaism have pretty strong abortion exceptions when it comes to saving the life of the mother, where the Christians here have made it so doctors face less accountability to let you die than provide you care. They also have exceptions for rape and incest, which is more than some US states. And speaking of incest, their incest issue, which has gotten worse under extremists, looks similar to America's issue with incest, child brides, especially young girls being married to middle-aged men, etc. It's just that Americans are taught that is an issue in those \"other countries\" and not an issue in their own backyard.  \n",

One of these ladies with \"chador-veil\" came towards me and grabbed my hand, she dragged me to take me to the van. My other friends escaped from them, and it was only me that was stuck. I was so stressed, I kept crying to the lady to let me go. But she wont let go of my arm. There were also soldiers accompanying the morality police as well. I was so worried because my parents thought I was at my friends and I basically lied to them to go the mall and I was so scared that where they would take me or they would do to me☹️ I was lucky that I was able to pinch the lady's hand with my nails and free myself. She kept shouting \" come back\" at me while I was running away. I was able to hide myself in a store, in their fitting room and waited there till the police van was full and I could go out! PS: I was wearing my hijab and they didnt like that I had red lipstick on, with my bangs showing out my scarf (Of course I was 14 and I wanted to do make up and be a teenage) but it was definitely one of my worst memories that I have living in Iran dealing with morality police\n",

Much of this is because released inmates are dumped back on the street with nothing, thus typically reliant on the same people in the same social networks that landed them in prison (this can even be parents or partners who are unwitting and well-meaning enablers).

Human autopilot is STRONG. Many (relative to zero, but a very small % of all) convicts have put themselves *back* in prison because they can't adapt to a world that's now 15 or 20 years later. Imagine going to prison with cassette tapes and rotary phones and now the very *idea* someone doesn't have a social media account is anathema.

It originated in the medieval century from Christians who viewed all non-christians as infidels, and then got passed on via Mecca to Muhammad's vocabulary. In addition, Hell is *not* the blessed love of the creator, nor is it a pleasant place to reside. Most often it is described as 'fire' (Al-nar) as in the following verses:\"...fear the Fire whose fuel is men and stones,- which is prepared for those who reject Faith\" (2:24).\"...Enough is Hell for a burning fire. Those who reject Our Signs, We shall soon cast into the Fire...

Wearing a scarf because you like it is fine, plenty of African cultures (not ones that practice Islam) have a whole culture around scarf wearing but the difference is they do it because of culture and freedom of expression, people who wear hijabs are doing because their religion is telling them that should because if they don’t their will be consequences. And I’m not for banning hijabs but it’s this disconnect that causes people robot understand the main problem here. The ideology is the problem, we need to stop dressing up and excusing religion for all its crimes against humanity.

Iran only just started forcing women to their ultrasounds before an abortion when we've been doing that in America for decades. Not to mention, both Islam and Judaism have pretty strong abortion exceptions when it comes to saving the life of the mother, where the Christians here have made it so doctors face less accountability to let you die than provide you care. They also have exceptions for rape and incest, which is more than some US states. And speaking of incest, their incest issue, which has gotten worse under extremists, looks similar to America's issue with incest, child brides, especially young girls being married to middle-aged men, etc. It's just that Americans are taught that is an issue in those \"other countries\" and not an issue in their own backyard.  \n",
