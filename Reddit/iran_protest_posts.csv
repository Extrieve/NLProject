*****
> Almost 12,500 people have been arrested and nearly 250 killed since the street protests began in Iran, according to a prominent human rights group, with thousands of anxious families struggling to make contact with loved ones who have gone missing and presumed to be in jail.

> As many as 200 refinery workers have been arrested since their protests started a fortnight ago.

> The Centre for Human Rights in Iran said 3,000 had been arrested in Tehran province alone, of which 835 remained in jail including 200 university students.

> Mohammad Mehdi Esmaili, the minister of guidance, said the number of journalists that remained under arrest was not high, but according to the International Federation of Journalists, 24 have been arrested since the protests started with 11 being held in Evin prison.

> In one case seen as typical, Maryam Mazrouei, a journalist and a well-known news photographer, has twice been arrested, and was apparently released on Thursday after 12 days in detention.

> Security forces arrested writer and journalist Mandana Sadeghi and her husband, Reza Mohammadi, at their house in Abadan.

Reddit is not that popular in Iran, and I believe this is why they didn't consider it ""threatening"" enough to filter. 

Today was an important day for the Iranians, as many (MANY) people in a vast majority of the cities have come to the streets to protest, and Tajrish Bazaar in Tehran (plus many stores in various parts of the country) have gone on strike. 

As an added bonus, the 21:00 IRIB news was attacked by a hacktivist group called ""Edaalat-e Ali"" with a picture of Khamenei in flames and pictures of the regime's victims being displayed on national TV for a few seconds. 

So, that's what happened on day 22 of the protests. Now, ask me anything you want to know about the protests and I'll try to explain everything best I can. 

Please be kind (not towards the IR!) and note that the internet situation is quite sh*tty here, so I may not be able to answer you ASAP.

> BERLIN - Swiss police used rubber bullets to disperse protesters in front of the Iranian Embassy in Bern after two men climbed over the embassy&#039;s fence and pulled down the Iranian flag from a flagpole in the yard.

> Police said late Saturday that nobody was injured and that the &quot;Large crowd&quot; of protesters was dispersed after the use of rubber bullets.

> The two protesters who entered the embassy&#039;s grounds were detained, according to police in the Swiss capital.

> Police said they used rubber bullets after several other protesters at the unauthorized demonstration tried following the two men who had first entered the embassy&#039;s yard and also attempted to access the premises.

> Thousands of Iranians have taken to the streets over the last two weeks in protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who had been detained by the morality police in the capital, Tehran, for allegedly wearing her mandatory Islamic headscarf too loosely.

> Outside of Iran, thousands of protesters have also staged demonstrations in European countries and elsewhere over the death of Amini.

Around us, the Iranian mountains reach skywards. We‚Äôre at a bus station in Penjwen, a town in Iraq‚Äôs northern Kurdistan region that is close to the crossing post on the border with Iran. Cars sporadically pull in and discharge their occupants into the dusty courtyard. Some pause and drink tea, while others climb straight into the small minibuses that‚Äôll take them to the nearby Iraqi city of Sulaimaniya.",https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Apadana21/comments/y2rmc0/tales_of_bloody_iran_protest_crackdown_at_border/,1665643388.0
