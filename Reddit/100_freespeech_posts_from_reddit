0,I'm going to start banning people for misrepresenting the right to free speech.,481,p9mgxt,FreeSpeech,https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeSpeech/comments/p9mgxt/im_going_to_start_banning_people_for/,1473,"Too often on this subreddit have I seen gross misrepresentations of the right to free speech.

The right to Free Speech is not the First Amendment to the US constitution.

The first amendment provides limited protection for free speech by disallowing the government from restricting it, but the first amendment does not *define* what free speech is.

Randall Munroe is to a large extent to blame for this belief, and his widely quoted [XKCD comic](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeSpeech/comments/4jq1et/im_tired_of_seeing_the_same_xkcd_comic_being/) has damaged the idea of free speech immeasurably.

Anybody that expresses a belief that free speech can *only* be restricted by the government will henceforth be banned from this subreddit under the long-standing Rule 7.

Note: some miscreants have cynically attempted to evade bans by asserting the contrapositive.

Bans will also apply to those asserting that if a private company censors speech, it does not infringe free-speech rights.",1629671280.0

They could buy strictly from ethical lines that are much more expensive or go without. But they are all talk. There is not difference between a slave master owning slaves and taking the fruits of their labor and a “social justice warrior” buying from a Cambodian sweat shop. Sweat shops that have nets so when the worker throws themselves over the edge they can’t pass away the conditions are so bad. 

These SJW are in tune with human rights current events. They know where their cheap goods come from. They can all stop acting like they would NOT have done what everyone else did 150 years ago as they are knowingly participating in that same exchange TODAY.

26,The Paradox of Intolerance and why most people misunderstand it.,46,xwfomx,FreeSpeech,https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeSpeech/comments/xwfomx/the_paradox_of_intolerance_and_why_most_people/,58,"You've probably seen this image before:

https://i.redd.it/vl00mm78jpq61.jpg

If you believe in and agree with the ideas expressed in this comic, then **you've been misled**. This comic leaves out some critical and necessary nuance that his book includes. Also, keep in mind that, when you invoke this paradox, you're basing your argument on a comic, based on one man's opinion of how society should function. It's not a law of the universe that he discovered. It's not like gravity or electromagnetic forces. Stop using it as the end-all-be-all argument to justify censorship.

But if you still insist on using it, you should actually read the whole thing and understand it.

Here's the full quote:

> 
> Less well known [than other paradoxes] is the paradox of tolerance: Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.—In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be most unwise. But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant. We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping, or to the revival of the slave trade, as criminal.


The part the comic leaves out, and the part that people often get wrong, is in the third sentence: ""**...I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be most unwise**""

So according to this paradox, it would be ""unwise"" to philosophies that you consider to be intolerant. Hate speech, Nazi philosophies, and the like. None of that should be suppressed. That's the first part that most people get wrong, they want to suppress right off the bat without even trying the ""rational argument"" approach.

So when IS it proper to suppress, according to this one man's opinion? 

When they ""...are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols.""

The Paradox isn't ""we can't give them an inch, because before you know it, we'll wake up in Nazi Germany!"" as some people seem to think. No, it's ""**as long as they're willing to argue rationally, it's fine**"".

ONLY when it's clear that they're NOT going to be using their words, but instead, will be using violence, then should society use force.

**Tolerating intolerance is fine**, and will not inevitably lead to the space being taken over by evil people. Karl Popper never said that. The ""Paradox"" is not about instantly suppressing ""intolerant"" speech.  If this is new information to you then you were fooled by a comic on the internet.


---

tl;dr - intolerant philosophies should not be suppressed as long as they're willing to fight with words, not fists.

90,How to spot the not so obvious anti free speech,0,xqgzd9,FreeSpeech,https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeSpeech/comments/xqgzd9/how_to_spot_the_not_so_obvious_anti_free_speech/,35,"Sometimes it’s very easy to see when someone is against free speech. A company is against free speech when they remove posts they don’t like. Or when they don’t allow a speaker they disagree with to speak. But sometimes it can be difficult to spot something that’s anti free speech. Once you understand the tricks though, it’s easy to spot.

The easiest way to be anti free speech and hide it is just to say the reason you’re doing it is for some other reason that people are for. Some examples. You may want schools to stop presenting history a certain way. So, what you do is attack what the school is teaching. Instead of removing the free speech of the teacher to teach facts, you say it’s racist against the majority white students. Then you find an obscure theory and convince people that critical race theory is being taught to their kids and the school is saying their kid is racist. You attack free speech, but you do it by convincing people you’re attacking something else. Another example is LGBTQ. Instead of just coming out and saying you’re against the free speech of gay people, you say teaching this to young kids is bad and you call these people groomers. You convince people these “groomers” are teaching kids they’re not the actual sex they were born into and these groomers are a danger to their kid. And you remove LGBTQ talk in schools. (Then you tell people to go to church on Sundays where there’s a history of sexual assault). We can move beyond the school system and look at companies. When two companies do the same thing to limit speech, you convince people the reason or way they’re doing it is different. So, you may have employees of one company disliking something in society and they kneel for the national anthem. While they have no affect on their job performance, people who dislike it say they shouldn’t be allow to express themselves because it’s done on company time. It’s important to remember the most powerful strikes and labor movements were done on company time. One more example is maybe the worst attack. Voting is one of the most powerful ways someone can voice their opinion. So, like the others, you create a different reason. You say something like, we need more secure voting. There are rampant illegal votes. Even though there is almost no evidence of voter fraud. And what you do is, to make voting “more secure” you make it more difficult for people to vote that you don’t want to vote. Again, the reason they give is security, but they’re really just removing peoples ability to vote, which is a way to express oneself.

I like to think of what the Republican campaign consultant Lee Atwater once said

> You start out in 1954 by saying, “Nigger, nigger, nigger.” By 1968 you can’t say “nigger”—that hurts you, backfires. So you say stuff like, uh, forced busing, states’ rights, and all that stuff, and you’re getting so abstract. Now, you’re talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you’re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is, blacks get hurt worse than whites.… “We want to cut this,” is much more abstract than even the busing thing, uh, and a hell of a lot more abstract than “Nigger, nigger.”

Taking this strategy and relating it to free speech, instead of just removing speech we don’t like, you give a different name to it and then you remove that idea, but in the end, it’s removing free speech.

As you can see, it may be difficult to spot, but with these tools, and practice, you too can spot anti free speech when it’s not so obvious.",1664381868.0

All polite, but from differing views of course.
30 mins later auto message, that I had been banned because I belonged to r/conservative, I also belong & contribute to r/politics, hardly the home of Trump supporters.

Today I was banned from r/pics, political image with associated commentry about Italian election.
I added a comment that SM reaction to conservative governments being elected was insane & conservative didn't equate to fascism.

My comment was upvoted & an opposing view down voted....that was enough to receive a ban.

My 2nd life on Reddit over 2 years now & for what it's worth 35, 000 comment karma, so I participate & am on Reddit a lot.

How does a commercial enterprise work, if unpaid volunteers have the authority to ban you just because they don't like your views

Isn't this a commercial conflict for a business that generates its income from advertising  ?

Obviously most moderators would prefer a very narrow range of views represented, but surely the commercial business has a vested interest in growing the audience to attract advertisers ?",1664246044.0
